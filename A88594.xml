            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> the beſt Chriſtian; And what could ſuſtain and beare us up under them all, but the certain hope and expectation of <hi>a better Reſurrection?</hi> This makes Chriſtians <hi>glory in tribulation,</hi> deſpiſe all the glory of the world, run as ſwiftly in wayes of duty, as the <hi>charets of Amminadab;</hi> in a word, to enjoy a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon earth. They therefore are the greateſt enemies of a Chriſtians comfort, that teach a doctrine of doubting; that a Chriſtian muſt alwayes hang in ſuſpenſe about his eternal ſtate; and can never arrive to any certainty, whether he ſhall be ſaved or no.</p>
            <p>But as this aſſurance is excellent, ſo is it hard to come by; <hi>Difficilia quae pulchra.</hi> 'Tis not to be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great deal of labour and diligence. 'Tis uſually
<pb facs="tcp:115140:3"/>the fruit of much prayer, and care, and humiliation, and long-waiting; thoſe that come by it ſo eaſily, and get it ſo ſoon, have great cauſe to ſuſpect that their aſſurance is not of the right kinde; Carnal ſecurity and preſumption is eaſily attained, but Chriſtian aſſurance not without great difficulty.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore much to be lamented, that there is ſo little diligence uſed, for obtaining the aſſurance of our effectual Calling and eternal Election, which is of ſuch great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to every Chriſtian. What care do men take, &amp; what diligence do they give to make ſure their lands, and goods, and worldly eſtates? They cannot be at reſt till they have ſecured theſe; But upon what uncertainties do they venture the ſalvation of their precious and immortal ſouls? They run the moſt deſparate hazards of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſalvation; never conſider whether they are in the way to heaven or hell, until they drop irrecoverably into the bottomleſſe pit. Oh what a ſtrange madneſſe poſſeſſeth the mindes of men, that they ſhould look no more to their own ſafety; that they think it wiſedome to ſecure every thing except their own ſoules. What evil have they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of you, that you ſhould neglect them ſo much?</p>
            <p>The deſigne of this Treatiſe is to awaken men from their ſecurity, and to ſtirre them up to give all diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure. It was handled by the Author as a juſt Conſectary from the doctrine of the <hi>Glory of Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Torments of Hell,</hi> (which Treatiſe is already publiſhed) as appears in the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this diſcourſe; That ſeeing there is ſuch glory prepared for the Elect, and ſuch torments for the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it concerns every Chriſtian to give all diligence to make ſure to himſelf, that he ſhall attain the one, and eſcape
<pb facs="tcp:115140:3"/>the other; So that theſe three Treatiſes have dependance upon each other, and together make up one compleat Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme. In this laſt thou wilt finde many practical caſes handled, of great ſoul-concernment, both for the comfort of ſuch as are ſincere, and the diſcovery of thoſe that are unſound.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O give you an account why I pitch'd upon theſe words, it is briefly thus. Having ſpent ſeventeen Sermons in treating of the Glory of Heaven for the Elect, and of the Torments of Hell for the Reprobate; I deem'd it moſt meet to ſhut up thoſe two Doctrines in the proſecution of this Subject, of the <hi>Aſſurance of our Election and Vocation,</hi> that ſo if this Doctrine be well improved, you may have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in your own hearts, that you are freed from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115140:5"/>torments of the Damned, and may be confident you ſhall be ſtated into the Glory of Heaven, which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for all his Saints. And to the end you might have aſſurance, that you ſhall be freed from the one, and ſhall enjoy the other, you muſt make it your work, according to the words of my Text, <hi>to make your Calling and Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure:</hi> Make but that ſure, and you are ſure of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This is the reaſon why I pitch'd upon this Subject: And it is my care in preaching the Word, not to chuſe thoſe Texts that are moſt for my eaſe in ſtudy, but for your profit in hearing; that ſo one Subject might back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and one Subject might ſtrengthen another, and being put together, might more ſerve for your edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and knowledg.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſtand long in Prefacing: All that I have to do in the managing of theſe words, are theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew you the ſcope, and dependance of the words.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſenſe and meaning.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To draw out thoſe practical Obſervations which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flow from them: And then apply the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deduced.</p>
               <p>For the ſcope and dependance of theſe words: you may diſcern it lies thus: <hi>Peter,</hi> who is called an Apoſtle of the Circumciſion, that is, an Apoſtle whoſe work and Office it was to preach to the Circumciſed Jewes (as it was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Office to preach to the uncircumciſed Gentiles), he writ this Epiſtle to the diſperſed Jewes, that were ſcattered throughout the world, through <hi>Pontus, Aſia, Cappadocia, Galatia</hi> and <hi>Bythinia:</hi> Whence obſerve, <hi>Gods people are a ſcattered people.</hi> And to them he writes, that though they were perſons living in different places, yet they had the ſame faith: <hi>Simon Peter a ſervant and an Apoſtle of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to them that have obtained like precious faith.</hi> So that you ſee, the Spirit of God, where it works in men, though they live in different places, yet they ſhall all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115140:5"/>the ſame Truth, and all receive the ſame Faith: Though different in Language, yet but one God, and one Faith. The Spirit of God wrought the ſame Faith among thoſe ſcattered Chriſtians. And the Apoſtle writing to theſe Jewes, he begins his Epiſtle, firſt by way of Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Grace and peace be multiplied to you.</hi> 2. He writes by way of Conſolation, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. telling them that they are <hi>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> that they are <hi>call'd to Glory,</hi> and ſhall enjoy all the Promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: Theſe are the great props with which he bears up their hearts and comforts them by. Then 3. he proceeds by way of Exhortation, and Direction, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and that is, that they ſhould <hi>give diligence to add grace to grace,</hi> that they ſhould make it their <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I begin with the firſt, <hi>That in all matters of ſoul concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chriſtians ought to put forth a great deal of diligence.</hi> In the <hi>fifth</hi> verſe it is ſaid likewiſe, <hi>Give all diligence:</hi> as if all your chief endeavours ſhould be about the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your ſoul.</p>
               <p>In the managing of this Point, I ſhall lay down the Demonſtrations of it; then the Reaſons; then Apply it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> of it: It appears that in all Soul concernments you ſhould put forth a great deal of diligence, by thoſe Reſemblances that the work belonging to the ſalvation of the ſould is compared to in Scripture. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes the work of Chriſtianity in ſaving the ſoul is compared to a <hi>race: Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Let us lay aſide every weight, and run with patience the race that is ſet before us.</hi> So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24, 25. When you walk in your Gardens or Galleries, you take no pains; but when you run a race, you labour and ſtrive hard, and put forth all your ſtrength to attain the end. Why (Beloved) matters about the Soul, they are compared to the running of a race; to ſhew, what labours and endeavours you muſt put forth in all imployments of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is compared to <hi>wreſtling, Eph.</hi> 6.12. <hi>We wreſtle not againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt Principalities and Powers.</hi> And ſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. An alluſion to the <hi>Olympick</hi> games, and publick paſtimes, when men wreſtled before the common multitude, wherein they put forth all their ſtrength and skill to throw each other down: To note, that Chriſtianity is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115140:8"/>no ſlight work, but a wreſtling work, wherein a great deal of diligence and labour is to be put forth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is expreſſed in Scripture by fighting a Battel; 2 <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth.</hi> 4.7. <hi>We have fought a good fight.</hi> And, <hi>As good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers you have endured hardneſſe,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.3. Now when men are fighting for their lives, what care, and what labour, and what diligence do they put forth to ſave themſelves? And the work of Chriſtianity in the concernments of the Soul is ſet forth by this reſemblance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is compared to one being in an Agonie; <hi>Luke</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate;</hi> The word in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Strive,</hi> till you are in an Agonie, as Chriſt was: Chriſt was in an agonie in the Garden, when he ſweat drops of bloud; So ſaith <hi>Luke,</hi> Strive, and Strive, and ſtrive till you are in an agonie, that you ſweat bloud again in the work of your ſouls. Now put theſe together, That the work of Chriſtianitie is reſembled to a <hi>race,</hi> to a <hi>fight,</hi> to be in an <hi>agonie,</hi> to <hi>wreſtling,</hi> wherein men put forth the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their ſtrength; the Reſemblance will hold forth this, That you muſt put forth a great deal of diligence in all matters of Soul concernment.</p>
               <p>Now for the Reaſons, Why you muſt be thus diligent in the matters of Chriſtianitie. I ſhall lay down Ten.</p>

Now if you muſt put forth ſo much diligence, and uſe ſo much care to thrive in the Bodie, then much more for the Soul: The Soul is a more noble piece then the Bodie; and if you muſt work in your Calling, you muſt much more work out your ſalvation: If you muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for earth, you muſt much more labour for heaven: if you labour to laie up treaſure here, you ſhould much more

When God calls for your diligence in matters of ſoul Concernment, take this Caution; that you do not diſcharge your duty in expreſſing a great deal of zeal and diligence in matters of your ſoul, unleſſe you do it in a right manner, and to a right end. People think, if they can be diligent in hearing, and diligent in reading, and diligent in praying, and in receiving Sacraments; that then, they diſcharge their dutie, and anſwer the Command of my text, to be diligent. No Beloved, you do not anſwer your dutie to God in expreſſing diligence in that which is materially good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you do it in a right manner, and to a right end. You have an inſtance in <hi>Jehu:</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 10. He was a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous induſtrious man in many good matters concerning the worſhip of God: at one time he kild the worſhippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> at another time he puld down the houſes where they worſhipped, and broke the graven Images in pieces. At
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115140:13"/>another time he calls out to <hi>Jehonadab, to ſee his zeal for the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Wonderfull diligent! and yet all this was not done in a good manner, nor to a right end. Not in a good manner, becauſe it was but done by halfs, not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for though he deſtroyed the Images of <hi>Baal,</hi> yet he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipt the Idols at <hi>Bethel.</hi> And then not to a right end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not ſhew this zeal and induſtry out of any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme reference to Gods glory, but only out of a politick end; to eſtabliſh himſelf in his kingdom, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.31. So that you may put forth ſuch diligence in reading, and hearing, and in receiving, and the like; and yet, if not done in a right manner, and to a right end, you doe not perform the dutie of my Text. For take this as a Rule in Divinitie, that when God commands a dutie, all the circumſtances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the dutie muſt be obſerved, or elſe that dutie is not done aright. As when you pray, you muſt not leave out one circumſtance or qualitie required in a prayer, if ſo, God will not accept your prayer. So here, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands your diligence, if you are not diligent in a right manner, and to a right end, your diligence is not right.</p>

Though you put forth never ſo much diligence in the matters of your ſoul, all thoſe acts you do, are none or them meritorious: you do not get heaven for praying, nor get heaven for reading, nor get heaven for hearing, though haply you get not heaven without it.
<note place="margin">Cauſae ſine quibus non.</note> Good works, they may be cauſes of Salvation in this ſenſe, Cauſes without which you cannot be ſaved; but all your obedience, and all your diligence are no cauſes for which you are ſaved, or which may any way move God to ſave you.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This diligence, could you put it forth by your own ſtrength, you had ſomewhat wherein to boaſt; but all your diligence is put forth by a borrowed ſtrength, by a ſtrength derived from Jeſus Chriſt, by a ſtrength from the Covenant of grace; it is thence you fetch power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all acts of obedience, and ſpiritual diligence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It cannot merit, becauſe it is not perfect: nay, you are ſo far from meriting by your obedience, that you merit nothing but hell for the defects in your obedience, and the imperfections that are remaining in your beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>

Take this Caution, That though all the diligence you can put forth cannot be meritorious for God to ſave you; yet take this for truth, that the more you abound in ſpiritual induſtrie in the matters of the Soul, the more likely you are to receive fuller income of joy, and fuller in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace in your ſouls: <hi>To him that hath ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and it ſhall be given him much more abundantly:</hi> That is, to him that hath improved his graces, and uſed them wel, they ſhall be given more abundantly: <hi>Thou haſt been faithful in a little, thou ſhalt be ruler over much.</hi> The more you act, and the more diligent you are in the matters of your ſoul, the more likely you are to be eminent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in grace above others. It is a note that an Author hath upon the Apoſtle <hi>Paul. Pual</hi> was the moſt eminent of all the Apoſtles; no Apoſtle like <hi>Paul,</hi> none outſtript him. Now Divines ask the reaſon, why <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be more eminent then the reſt of the Apoſtles, who ſaw Chriſt in the fleſh; whereas <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw him onely in a viſion, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115140:14"/>no where elſe; yet <hi>Paul</hi> was more eminent then any other Apoſtle? and they give this reaſon: <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>in labours more abundant; Paul</hi> was more induſtrious, putting out his gifts and graces, and God did bleſſe that induſtry with a fuller increaſe of the graces of Gods Spirit then others had: So that, though God gives us not heaven for our growth in grace; yet ordinarily God intails a greater meaſure and increaſe of gifts upon the wel uſing of them while we are in the world: <hi>Open your mouthes wide, and God will fill them.</hi> The more wide we are in our deſires and expectations, the more we ſhall be filled.</p>

Why, how ſhould this condemn that great ſluggiſhneſs and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mens ſpirits, that they do ſo little in the matters of ſoul concernment?</p>
               <p>Beloved, you have cauſe to labour, becauſe you find many that have taken pains for Heaven, that never came to Heaven. <hi>Many ſhall ſtrive to enter, but ſhall not be able, Luke</hi> 13. Had not you therefore need to take heed? Nay, Beloved, ſuppoſe (it is a ſuppoſition <hi>Aegidius</hi> hath,

If all the world ſhould be ſaved but one man only; if only one man ſhould be damned, I have cauſe to labour with all my might, that I be not that one man. Here then, great cauſe you have, not to ly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſluggiſhneſs, in all matters pertaining to the ſoul. You have a great deal of work to do, and haply but a little time; if you knew the greatneſs of your work and ſhortneſſe of your time, haply you would now ſet about the buſineſs of your ſalvation. It was the ſpeech of young King <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> lying upon his death-bed: I have ſcarce yet begun to live, and now, wo is me, I am compelled to die. Beloved, Many of you may have cauſe to ſay thus, you have ſcarce yet done one good action, that may give you any evidence to be happie with Chriſt another day: Happily you have not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be Chriſtians, and you may be ſoon called to die;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115140:15"/>and what an affliction would this be to you, that you have hardly begun to live a life of grace, and yet you muſt die the life of nature. This <hi>diligence</hi> is converſant about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things. 1. In getting grace. Here you have a great work to do, to get grace, <hi>Above all gettings get under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:</hi> And the difficulty of getting grace, doth ſhew the goodneſs of grace. As we ſay in nature, the moſt vile things, are moſt obvious to the eye, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to be found; you have ſtones and dirt every where, but things of a more excellent nature, are more hard to come by; if you would have Gold, you muſt dig into the earth; if you would have Pearle, you muſt dive into the ſea: things that are excellent, nature hath made them hard to come by: This ſhewes the goodneſs of thoſe matters which concern the ſoul, that they are very hard to be got. Prov. 22, 4. <hi>Seek for wiſdome as for ſilver, and dig for it as for hidden Treaſure.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Non minor eſt virtus quam quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere parta tueri.</note> And then, 2.

And then 3. to watch the heart, that doth conſpire againſt your graces, and againſt your ſoul: Prov. 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of life.</hi> 4. In examining the heart: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.6 <hi>The heart is deep;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6. All theſe conſidered, you have cauſe to take pains in all the matters of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Thus having finiſh'd this Doctrine; I now paſs to the Particulars, to which this diligence is applied. <hi>Give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:</hi> to what? why, <hi>To make your Calling and Election ſure.</hi> From whence, the ſecond Obſervation I ſhal draw, is this:</p>

               </p>
               <p>Beloved, This is a very material Point I am now upon, eſpecially in this deceitful age, wherein men plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a gulph of preſumption, wherein many times men take faith upon truſt, and Chriſt upon truſt. It is meet that you that live under the Goſpel, ſhould trie your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by the Goſpel, whether it be true or no; there may be an external Cal, when there is no inward calling by the operation of the Spirit upon your hearts.</p>
               <p>In the managing of this Point, I ſhall ſhew you theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What Effectual Calling is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why you are required to put forth a great deal of diligence, to make your Calling ſure to your ſouls?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By what Characters or Diſcoveries you may be aſſured in your own hearts that you are effectually called.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What Effectual Calling is? You ſay we muſt make it ſure, therefore what is the nature of it? For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, you may take this deſcription of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Effectual Calling is the fruit of Gods Election, whereby God of his free grace works a wonderful change in the heart of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect perſon, by the inward operation of the Spirit accompanying the outward Miniſtry of the word; by vertue of which, the ſoul is brought from under the dominion of ſin and Satan, into a ſtate of grace, and ſo made meet for the enjoyment of God in glory.</hi> Now I ſhal not take this apart, but commit it to your memorie and judgment to apprehend: Only in this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there are laid down four differences to diſtinguiſh ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:115140:17"/>Calling from that ordinary or outward Calling that wicked men have by the Miniſtrie of the Word. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. Effectual Calling in the deſcription, is ſaid to be a <hi>fruit of Gods Election;</hi> but outward or general Calling is a fruit only of common providence. God by an over-ruling providence ſends the Goſpel among a people, and thereby calls them to an outward compliance and conformitie; but effectual Calling is a fruit of Gods Election.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſaid in the deſcription, that Effectual Calling, it changes the heart, <hi>whereby God works a wonderful change in the heart:</hi> but an external Calling no way reacheth the heart, only worketh ſome kind of civil or common altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's ſaid, Effectual Calling is wrought <hi>by the inward operation of the Spirit accompanying the outward Miniſtry of the word;</hi> whereas an External Call is only by the word, but no inward ſaving work of the Spirit at all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Its ſaid of Effectual Calling, that it is from the <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin;</hi> but External Calling is only from the external acts of ſin. Indeed by an external calling the word may have that power over a man, as to reſtrain and keep in the viſible and external actings of ſin, but it no way works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inclination to take off the affection from ſin: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this effectual Calling works upon the heart, and works to the ſubduing and deſtroying of the power of ſin, as well as the actings of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why doth God require, that we ſhould put forth ſuch great diligence in making ſure that we are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called, by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? There are three Reaſons why this ſhould be?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> Firſt,  Becauſe there are many profeſſing the Goſpel, that do harbour ungrounded perſwaſions that they are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called, when they are not. Now if many men be deceived, why may not you? And if many are apt to be deceived about this matter, have not you great cauſe to be diligent, leſt you are deceived alſo? The Jewes of old, they boaſted of their Calling; and ſaid, <hi>We have Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115140:17"/>to our father:</hi> but Chriſt confutes that; <hi>If you were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams children</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you would do the works of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: but you ſeek to kill me, which Abraham did not.</hi> But then they go higher, <hi>John</hi> 8.46. they were effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>For God is our Father:</hi> No, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>You are of your father the Divel.</hi> Thus many men run into theſe groſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, to believe they are effectually called, when they are not. Many are called outwardly that are not called effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. And therefore it concerns you, not to be deceived in this great buſineſs.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> Secondly,  Becauſe there is this natural aptneſs in all of us, in things that are of any value concerning the bodie; you wil be ſure to make ſure of them. It may be, if you have Braſs and Pewter, or baſer Mettals, your Kitchin ſhal ſerve for that; but things of greater value, as Pearls and Diamonds, they muſt be in the Cloſet, and in a Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net in that Cloſet, you wil be ſure to enſure them. Why, how much more ſhould you enſure this great and precious Jewel of Effectual Calling, that ſo much concerns your immortal ſouls? When you buy Land, you will be ſure your Title is good; to draw up your evidences, ſo as to be firm in Law. You know Merchants, if they venture a great or moſt part of their eſtate at ſea, where happily there may be hazard in the Voyage, they will run ſpeedily to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a great part of their Commodities. Beloved, this ſhould you do; this bodie of yours is the Ship, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize and Freight in this Ship is your ſouls; and this Ship is going a great Voyage to Glorie, Glorie is the Port whither this Ship is to come; you ſhall meet with many dangers in your way, haply with ſtorms and tempeſts of temptation; yea, haply you may run upon the rocks of preſumption, or quick-ſands of deſpair. O now, run to the enſuring Office: what's that? why, run to ſeek the Teſtimonie of Chriſts Spirit in your own Spirit, by the word, to evidence unto you upon good ground, that the Ship ſhal be ſafe, and the Commodities brought ſecure to the Haven; that Ship, Bodie, Soul and all ſhal come ſafe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115140:18"/>to Heaven. Beloved, if men wil thus enſure their Eſtates, you have much more reaſon to enſure your ſouls. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, if you make not ſure your ſouls, if you ſuffer ſhipwrack, ye are turned Bankrupts preſently; bankrupt to God, you loſe him for ever. It is ſaid of an old Uſurer, That when any man came to borrow money of him, he would hardly truſt one in twentie; and being ask'd the reaſon, Why he would do ſo? O (ſaith he) it is good to be ſure. Why (Beloved) ſhal an Uſurer in all his ways be ſo ſecure, and ſo heedful in all his disburſments, that he could ſay, It is good to be ſure? and may not I much more ſay to you, It is good to be ſure of heaven? it is good to be ſure you are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt; it is good to be ſure that you are Chriſtians in truth, not in name only; that you are Chriſtians in Deed, not in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion only. O it is good to make your Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> Thirdly,  Chriſtians ſhould labour to aſſure this, becauſe the more aſſured you are of your Effectual Calling, the more it wil heighten and increaſe your inward peace and comfort, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>In whom believing, ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakeable and full of glory.</hi> It is verie obſervable, that in all the Epiſtles of the New Teſtament, where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of their effectual calling to be Saints, in the very next verſe he ſalutes them with theſe words, <hi>Grace and Peace be towards you,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>You are called to be Saints, Grace and peace be towards you.</hi> Rom. 1 6, 7. <hi>Called to be Saints grace and peace be multiplied towards you</hi> and ſo in everie Epiſtle beſides; to note that when a man is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, the more aſſurance he hath of his calling, the more peace he hath in his own conſcience. It wil greaten your peace, and greaten your inward comforts, therefore you ſhould labour after this aſſurance of your effectual Calling.</p>
               <p>And thus having ſhewn you what Effectual Calling is, and why you muſt give diligence to make this ſure: I now paſs to a third Querie.</p>
               <p>What are the Characters or diſcoveries, whereby my
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115140:18"/>ſoul may be aſſured that I am effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt? And in the diſpatch of this, I ſhal reſolve it only by theſe two general heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, You may be aſſured of your effectual Calling, if God hath taken that method with your ſouls, which he doth ordinarily take with thoſe, whom he doth effectually call.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the Lord hath wrought in you thoſe ſaving effects or concomitants, which do ordinarily accompanie thoſe that are thus effectually called: if theſe two things be done, you may have a ſeal, and aſſurance in your own hearts, that you alſo are effectually called. Beloved, it is not for Miniſters to flatter you: there are among many in the world, but few that are called; among many that are called, but few elected; and therefore do not flatter your ſelves. If upon trial you find you are not in the number of Gods Called ones, go home and bewail your unregerie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unconverted eſtate. But before I can ſpeak of this method, I muſt firſt lay down ſome miſtakes, that are held by erroneous minds about the method God takes in calling a ſinner home to himſelf.</p>
               <p>A firſt miſtake is of the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> who hold this, that a man is able to call and convert himſelf. Now this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth quite exclude and juſtle out God from having any hand therein: they ſay, A Chriſtian is able to call and convert himſelf, having only a general concurrence and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>Arminians;</hi> and they hold this, That Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Calling conſiſts only in moral perſwaſions, and may be reſiſted by the perſon that is thus called; and that a man being called into a ſtate of grace, may fall from his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and fall from his grace, and ſo have no profit by his Calling at all; which is a moſt uncomfortable opinion; and ſurely God would never take this method in calling of his people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> &amp; they ſay, That God cals &amp; ordains a ſinner to glorie, but it is upon the foreſight of his good
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115140:19"/>works. God foreſaw how good and holie the man would be, and therefore God would chuſe and call him to glorie. But this hath no ground from Scripture nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That of the <hi>Familiſts;</hi> and they hold this, That Gods method in calling a ſinner is not by the outward Miniſtrie of the word, but it is by raptures and revelations, and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpirations, and extraordinarie waies of working: but this is not Gods uſual method, though God ſometimes take this way, as he did by <hi>Paul,</hi> who was called this way after an extraordinarie manner: Yet this is not Gods odina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie rule.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is another Miſtake, and that is of thoſe who preſs a neceſſitie of ſuch meaſures of legal horrour and terror upon the conſciences of men, elſe they can never be ſaved. Sometimes Miniſters have been ſo harſh now and then, (though indeed no ſuch cauſe to blame them as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) yet ſometimes laſhes break out, that men muſt be ſo and ſo humbled, in ſuch a meaſure, and ſo long for durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now this is not Gods method to preſs for meaſure, but a great miſtake about Gods manner of calling a ſinner; though I muſt confeſs, this is the neareſt of all the five, to that rule God takes in calling a ſinner to glorie. Having thus laid down the miſtakes, 'tis the eaſier now to find out the truth. I come now to ſpeak of that method God takes in calling a ſinner. And here I ſhall lay down a ſixfold method, in which God proceeds with thoſe whom he doth effectually call, which if he doth ſo with you, you may go home with a ſeal upon your hearts, that you are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called to grace, and you ſhall one day come to glorie.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When God goes about effectually to call a poor ſinner into a ſtate of grace, he puts a clear light into his ſoul, whereby he may ſee the hainous and aggravated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all his ſins, more then ever he did before. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8, 8, 13. <hi>Paul</hi> tels you, <hi>Before the commandment came, he was alive, and ſin was dead;</hi> that is, before the power of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115140:19"/>the word came upon his conſcience to convert him, he was alive; <hi>i, e.</hi> he thought he was a good man, and a juſt man, and he thought ſin was dead, ſin was deſtroied; he never knew ſin ſo ſinful: <hi>but when the commandment came ſin revived, and I died:</hi> but when the word of God came with power upon my conſcience, and light upon my judgment, then I ſaw I was a dead man, ſin had kild me, and I ſaw ſin was raigning, and ſin was raging in me: and what then? ver. 13. <hi>I ſaw ſin exceeding ſinful:</hi> he never ſaw ſin ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore converſion, before his Call, when he was a <hi>Phariſee;</hi> but when the word of God came with power upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to call him, then ſaith he, <hi>I ſaw ſin to be exceeding ſinful.</hi> Now (O Beloved) hath ever God done thus with your ſouls? may be you look upon ſin with a tranſient and general view, but do you look upon ſin ſo as to ſee more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in ſin then ever you ſaw before? This is the courſe God uſually takes. Me thinks God deals with a converted ſinner, as it is ſpoken in <hi>Job</hi> 33.27, 28. <hi>He looketh upon men, and if any ſay, I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right, and it doth not profit me, he will deliver his ſoul from going down into the pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light:</hi> that is, God looks upon the maſs of mankind in the world, and ſaith, if any man ſay he hath ſinned, and it did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him, that is, if he look upon ſin as an evil, and that he never did get good by it: then ſaith God, I will deliver his ſoul from hel, and bring him to heaven.</p>

Now, O Beloved, to how many do I ſpeak this day with: whom God hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taken this Method, ſince they were born into the world? How many are there that have been told of their drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and told of their luſts, and of their deceits, and of their licentious living from day to day; and yet to this day they never ſaw ſin to be exceeding ſinfull; they never were convinced of ſin to purpoſe? If they did indeed ſee their ſin, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they did ſee ſin, it was an unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſight; the ſight of ſin did never humble them in Gods ſight. I intreat you, Beloved, do not laie hold or have hopes of being effectually call'd, if God hath not ſhewn you the hainous and aggravated nature of your ſins. There is a ſpeech, <hi>Job.</hi> 36.9, 10. <hi>He firſt ſhews to men their works, and their tranſgreſſions, that they have exceeded; and then he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens their ears to diſcipline, and commands them to return from evil.</hi> Mark, then the Lord doth it, when he makes them ſee their tranſgreſſions, that they have exceeded; Now, Have you ſeen that you have exceeded in your Paſſions, and in your Pride? have you ſeen ſin to be exceeding ſinful? this is Gods firſt work; and happie are you that are brought into Chriſts School, that Chriſt doth take this Method withall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After God hath put a light into the ſoul, to make you ſee the ſin fulneſſe of ſin; then 2. God faſtens theſe thoughts on the ſoul, to make you ſenſible of the great miſery that your ſins have brought you into; to cry out with <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.24. <hi>Wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> There <hi>Paul</hi> cryes out of his wretchedneſſe and miſery, by reaſon of that body of death, the ſinfulneſſe of his nature, which he confeſſes did as much trouble him,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115140:20"/>as if a dead body ſhould be tyed to his living body; alluding to the cuſtome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in puniſhing notorious Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, which he takes to be a moſt grievous puniſhment. Why Beloved, have you ever ſeen this? did you ever ſee that miſery that ſin brought upon you? that ſin did deveſt you of righteouſneſſe, did rob you of your God, baniſh you from his preſence, intitle you to hell and make you objects of his wrath? Now were you ſenſible of this miſery? this is Gods method, to make you ſee your miſery by reaſon of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God puts the ſoul into a kind of ſpirituall aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the poor ſinner doth not know where to goe, what courſe to take, which way to turn, how he may get pardon for his ſin, and recoverie from his miſerie. This you find mentioned as Gods method, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. upon 3000 at once, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> They were even in a maze, the word wrought upon them, and they ſaw Jeſus Chriſt crucified to be their ſin; and now they crie out in great aſtoniſhment, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> When God effectually calls a man, he will leave him a little to himſelf, that he knows not which way in the world to turn him. Now when I ſpeak of ſpiritual Aſtoniſhment, miſtake me not; for Firſt, I preſs not ſuch a meaſure of Humiliation, nor ſuch a meaſure of trouble of mind, how great it muſt be; Nor Secondly do I preſs the duration of it; how long it muſt be; that you muſt be ſo long and ſo long. Nor Thirdly, doe I preſs an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſsitie of this, as if a man could not be call'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Indeed, we read of <hi>Lydia, that her heart was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and ſhe never troubled nor aſtoniſht; and God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times works thus in an extraordinarie way: but I preſs this, that ordinarily, its Gods Method in ſome meaſure or other, at ſome time or other, to put his people into ſuch a plunge, that they ſhall not know which way in the world to turne themſelves. And ſo were thoſe 3000 <hi>Acts</hi> 2. They could not tell what they ſhould do to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>And here further, if you ask me, With whom doth God
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115140:21"/>moſt of all take this courſe, to put them into ſuch ſpirituall amazement; to put them into horror and terror about their everlaſting eſtate? I Anſwer, firſt, Thoſe that have liv'd in a courſe of profaneneſs before Converſion; let them look to it: if thou haſt been a knottie and ſtout-hearted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt God, God muſt give thee many a blow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can hammer thee to his own will. You that have been guiltie of Drunkenneſs, and guiltie of Adultery, or guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Sabbath-breaking in a groſs and licencious way, that have made this world a ſtage to act wickedneſſe upon, look to it; boaſt not of your Calling: if God hath not brought you in this way, you have ground to ſuſpect, you are not yet call'd. They that before Converſion were looſe in their lives, if they find not this ſpirituall amazement, it is not likely they are call'd. And therefore I verily ſuſpect your Call, that can jump out of a courſe of Profaneneſſe, into a courſe of Profeſſion; that can jump from a courſe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignitie to delight to hear Sermons, and love Miniſters. You that have been oppoſers of godlineſs, if you do not ſhew an eminent work in your Converſion, I greatly ſuſpect, whether you are converted or no: becauſe it is Gods uſuall Method, if men have been men of groſs lives before cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to bring them to great aſtoniſhment when they are called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You that have often withſtood, and ſtill withſtand Gods call; that Sermon after Sermon, and invitation after invitation would not gain upon you; Do you look about you; God will give you many a blow, God will ſend you many a ſad houre, before he brings you to your peace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that have often ſinn'd againſt Conſcience, that do as it were lay Conſcience waſt; that are prodigall of ſinning, not caring for ſinning againſt never ſo much light; and never ſo much conviction. Beloved, you ſhall not have ſo eaſie a coming to heaven: God wil firſt lay many ſtroaks upon you, and draw heavie groans from you. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, <hi>By reaſon of thy terrors I am afraid, and my bone are dried up:</hi> You are ſubject to moſt horror and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115140:21"/>that do ſin againſt Conſcience. Again,</p>
               <p n="4">4. When God hath done thus, made you ſee the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated nature of ſin, ſhewn you your miſery by reaſon of ſin, and brought you into ſuch a condition that you cannot tell how to be ſaved; then 4. this is Gods Method, to take you off from your own bottome, beat you off from reſting in duties, and beat you off from dependance upon graces, and beat you off from every thing in your ſelves. This was Gods work in <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>I was,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed the</hi> 8th <hi>day, of the ſtock of Iſrael, of the Tribe of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews;</hi> that is, my father and mother were Hebrews: what then? and I was, <hi>touching the Law, blameleſs.</hi> Mark, he was ſo ſtanding upon his own legs, upon his own bottome; that he thought himſelf a holy man, a man blameleſs touching the Law. <hi>But now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what things were gain to me, I count loſs for Chriſt; yea doubtleſſe, I count all things loſt, that I might be found in Chriſt, not having my own righteouſneſſe.</hi> Here <hi>Paul</hi> before Converſion depended upon his holy living, and honeſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but now I am converted, and ſee my folly; now <hi>I deſire to be found in Chriſt, not having mine own righteouſneſs.</hi> See how God did unbottome <hi>Paul</hi> from any goodneſs in himſelf, to make him reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt: and this is Gods work with thee; he will unbottome thee from thy ſelf, and make thee ſee thou canſt not be thine own Saviour.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After he hath unbottom'd thee from thy ſelf, he puts thee upon earneſt longings and looking after Jeſus Chriſt. When the poor ſoul hath ranſack'd duties, and gone to this Miniſter, and the other Miniſter, to be ſatisfied; and he ſees duties cannot help him, and prayer will not help him; now he thinks, I ſee none but Chriſt to lay my head upon: and I ſee none but a Chriſt I muſt make my recourſe unto: And now he is ſo longing after Chriſt, that if all the ſtones in the ſtreets were gold, and all the building of his houſe were diamond, and all his garments beſpangled with pear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e; none of theſe ſhould interrupt, or ſtay him from running after Jeſus Chriſt; and this, as I may ſay, is Gods ſecond
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115140:22"/>work: The three firſt may be in wicked men, they may ſee their ſin and miſerie thereby, and be in a maze not knowing which way to goe: but theſe two are a form beyond the wicked; they never unbottome themſelves, nor ever have any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or breathings after Chriſt at all.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is Gods method after all this, to make them find abundance of contentment, and acquieſcence in Jeſus Chriſt; that they may have occaſion to ſay, I ſee I have laid my help upon one that is mightie; I ſee I have picht upon him, that is both able and willing to do me good. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>hath given us everlaſting conſolation, and good hope through grace.</hi> And now Beloved, having ſpoken of theſe things, how many in the Congregation have I left hehind, that haply the Lord hath uſed none of theſe Methods with their ſouls? O Lord, I am not able to tell you your miſerie, but I intreat you take heed, and do not nuzzle up your ſouls in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and groundleſs Perſwaſions; for believe it, theſe are Gods ordinarie Methods he takes with moſt ſouls in bringing them to glorie.</p>

               <p>HAving finiſht the firſt part of the diſcoverie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Method God takes with thoſe whom he doth effectually call. I now proceed to the ſecond way of diſcoverie, and that is by thoſe ſaving
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115140:22"/>Concomitants, that doe and will accompanie a ſoul, that is effectually call'd: and theſe ſaving effects, I ſhall reduce under eight heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A man effectually call'd by Chriſt, he doth unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly love the word of God, and the Miniſter that preached that word that God did uſe as an inſtrument of his call. Firſt, I ſay, he will love the word, <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that is of God,</hi> (that is, he that is call'd by God) <hi>heareth Gods word, therefore you are not of God, becauſe you heare not his word.</hi> There the Scripture tels us, that they who are of God, effectually called by him, they heare his word with abundance of delight; and abundance of joy and love. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>He that is of God heareth us, he that is not of God heareth not us.</hi> And therefore <hi>David,</hi> when he would evidence a work of God upon his heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.14. <hi>Thy word,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is as great riches to me.</hi> And as if he did not value riches comparable to the word, <hi>verſ.</hi> 72. <hi>I love thy word above thouſands of gold, and ſilver.</hi> Beloved, if you are converted and called by Jeſus Chriſt, you will love the Word of God, that was an inſtrument of your Call. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all you that ſpurn againſt the Goſpel, that cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to have the word come with power upon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; all you that are weary of Ordinances, and finde no more ſavour in an Ordinance of God, then (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith) there is <hi>taſte in the white of an egg;</hi> this is an argument you are not yet called. What's the reaſon one man will riſe early, go far, take pains, and many times neglect his own lawfull affairs, and all to enjoy the Word: when another man will goe by the Church-door, and haply go to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and will not go to hear the Word at all? What's the reaſon? One is call'd by the Word, and the other not: one is called by the Word, and therefore loves it; another is not called, and that makes him neglect it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth not onely love the word, but the Miniſter that by preaching the word was an inſtrument of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. And therefore it is obſervable which ſome Divines note, That of all men that we read of in Scripture, there
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115140:23"/>was no man did love <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much as <hi>Timothie: For I have no man like minded,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2.22. <hi>No man that did ſo naturally care for him, and for the Church of God, as he; For as a ſon with his father, hath hee ſerved me.</hi> And what's the reaſon? Why, <hi>Paul</hi> was the inſtrument of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and <hi>Timothy</hi> being a Miniſter, and come to a great pitch in grace, hee thought that of all Arguments in the world, that ſhould indear him to love <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was the Miniſter that did convert him: therefore he calls him (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2.) <hi>Timothy his beloved ſon in the faith.</hi> And hence it is, that when the Apoſtle would draw love from the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to himſelf, and the Miniſters of Chriſt that were the means of their calling, hee urgeth it upon this ground, that they were the means that did beget them to Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Let a man ſo account of us, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and as Stewards of the myſteries of God.</hi> Why ſhould men ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them? <hi>For</hi> (ver. 15.) <hi>though you have ten thouſand Inſtructors, yet have you not many Fathers; for in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> Hereby he would draw out their love to him, becauſe he was the inſtrument that did firſt convert them. Now then, put theſe two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: A man that is effectually called, he doth both love the Word of Chriſt, that was an inſtrument of his calling; and the Miniſter that preach'd that word, which was the means by which he was called: and try your ſelves by theſe. Many of you haply have ſome good wrought (as you think) upon you, and ſome change in you; but truly let me tell you this, if you are perſons that are out of love with the Word, if you are out of love with thoſe Miniſters God made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to convert you; you have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect your calling; for you ſee thorowout the whole courſe of Scripture, their hearts did cleave with love to them that called them: And therefore they that can ſlight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn thoſe Miniſters by whoſe miniſtry they were brought home to Jeſus Chriſt, they have juſt cauſe of jealouſie to ſuſpect their Call. Again,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:115140:23"/>2. If God hath effectually called you, he will by his Spirit bring you out of a ſtate of ignorance and darkneſſe, and give you ſome meaſure of knowledg, to be acquainted both with the myſteries of God and Chriſt, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of your ſelves, more then ever you were before. This the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> intimates, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>You are a choſen generation, a royall Prieſthood, a peculiar people, that you may ſhew forth the praiſes of him, who hath called you out of darkneſſe into his marvellous light: i. e.</hi> out of ignorance into a great meaſure of knowledg. And it is called a <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light,</hi> 1. Becauſe it is marvellous if you compare that knowledg you ſhall have under the Goſpel, with what men had under the Law. 2. It is marvellous, becauſe men are aſtoniſh'd, that they ſhould, after ſo long a night of ignorance, come to ſo great a meaſure of knowledg. 3. It is called marvell us, becauſe it is ſo contrary to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they were formerly in: As if a man that hath lain long in a dark dungeon, ſhould be ſuddenly called into a glorious Palace, the Palace would ſeem more glorious, becauſe it is ſo contrary to the dark Priſon: So this work of God when he <hi>calls</hi> you, it is called <hi>marvellous light,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo contrary to the condition you were in before your <hi>calling. Iſa.</hi> 30.26. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>He hath ſent his word to call you from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than to God.</hi> 4. It is a <hi>marvellous light,</hi> becauſe ſuch as none but the Mediator could procure it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, 7. <hi>I will give thee for a light to the gentiles.</hi> 5. It is a <hi>marvellous light,</hi> becauſe a light that ſhines out of darkneſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God that commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe.</hi> 6. It is a <hi>marvellous light</hi> becauſe it hath more force then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light: 'tis called <hi>the light of life,</hi> Joh. 8.12.</p>
               <p>Now this call from darkneſſe to light hath two Branches: 1. A man ſhall have more light, to have more acquaintance with, and more clearneſſe in the myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt: And 2. more light to know the ſinfulneſſe of himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſhall have more light to know the myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt: And hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115140:24"/>
                  <hi>It pleaſed God to call me by his grace, and to reveal his Son in me;</hi> implying, that where God by his grace doth call a ſinner, he doth reveal his Son unto him. Wherefore, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, if Jeſus Chriſt be not made known to your ſouls, if you have no competent meaſure of the knowledg of Chriſt; you may be under this conviction, that you are not yet called by Jeſus Chriſt. Nay further, he doth not onely call you unto this light, to manifeſt Jeſus Chriſt to you in ſome dim way; but you ſhall have a clear light: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>For God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts</hi> (not in a dim, but ſhining light) <hi>to give us the light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> that is, you have a cleer light to know God in the face of Chriſt; you cannot know God in himſelf, but in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt you ſhall have light to know him. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the firſt Branch, That God will put a light into thy ſoul, whereby thou ſhalt have a clear knowledg of the things appertaining to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>Secondly,</hi> This light ſhall not onely reveal Chriſt to thee; but this light ſhall alſo reveal thy Self to thee, the ſinfulneſſe of thy ſelf. It is obſervable of <hi>Paul,</hi> that before his calling, <hi>he was after the law blameleſſe;</hi> he thought himſelf to be a faultleſſe man; but when the word called him, then he cryes out, <hi>I ſee ſin to be exceeding ſinfull:</hi> then he ſaw ſin to be ſin, and himſelf to be a vile and wretched man. And therefore, Beloved, any of you that have not this <hi>marvellous light</hi> in your ſouls, neither to know God, nor know Jeſus Chriſt, nor the matters appertaining to him, nor to know the ſinfulneſſe of your own hearts; take it from God, you are not effectually called: either theſe paſſages in Scripture muſt be raſed out, or elſe your call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt not be ſound; and therefore take heed: I would fain make my Miniſtrie ſearching, that hypocrites may not lie lurking under it. You would be better Chriſtians, if you were better acquainted with all that unſoundneſſe, and that wretchedneſſe of heart that is in you; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I intreat you) look about you: Though I would have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115140:24"/>no godly man diſcouraged by this that is ſpoken; but that you that are not yet called, might have your hearts a little ſtaggered by what is and will be ſaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man effectually called is caſt out of himſelf, and cleaves to, and cloſeth with Jeſus Chriſt, with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencie and contentment, then ever he could do in all his life before. <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>Hee that hath heard and learned of the father, ſhall come unto me;</hi> he doth not ſay, all they that <hi>hear</hi> of the father: many men do heare the word, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cloſe in with Chriſt; but all they that have heard, and by hearing have <hi>learnt,</hi> and are called, come unto mee, and cloſe in with me, and cleave to me, and take content and delight in me. Beloved, there are many that hear the word, yet never go out of themſelves, and never cloſe in with Chriſt: yea but all they that heare and learne, that hear and are called by hearing, they all come in to Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore all you, that in hearing cannot find your hearts in love with Chriſt, cannot find your hearts to cloſe in with Chriſt, and believe in Chriſt; you have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect your Call, that your calling is not effectual. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. The Apoſtle tels you, there were other men <hi>counted Chriſt fooliſhneſſe; but to you that are called, Chriſt is the power and wiſedome of God:</hi> that is, you do acknowledg, and you do conceive of Jeſus Chriſt, that he hath as much power as God hath in him, and as much wiſedome as God hath in him; and you cloſe in with Chriſt for that end, when other men think Chriſt to be fooliſh, and Chriſt weak; men uncall'd, they have low thoughts of Chriſt; <hi>but to you that are call'd, Chriſt is the power and wiſedome of God:</hi> You will have high thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt if you are effectually called.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That man that is effectually called, he ſhall be inabled by the ſpirit of Chriſt to call upon God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>To all in Corinth called to be Saints, with all that call upon the name of the Lord.</hi> There the Apoſtle joynes <hi>called to be Saints,</hi> with this phraſe, <hi>to call upon God;</hi> to ſhew, that whoever is effectually called to be a Saint, that man ſhall be inabled by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115140:25"/>the Spirit of Jeſus, to call upon God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8. <hi>When thouſaideſt, Seek my face; my heart ſaid unto thee, thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> Hence ye read, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. when <hi>Ananias</hi> doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether <hi>Paul</hi> was truely call'd or no, and Jeſus Chriſt would convince <hi>Ananias</hi> that he was truely call'd; what means doth he uſe? <hi>verſe</hi> 11. do not ſuſpect him, <hi>but ariſe</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and goe to him into the ſtreet, called Straight; and enquire at the houſe of Judas for one Saul of Tarſus, for behold he prayeth.</hi> If he were not call'd, he would never goe to God in ſuch a cordiall way, and humble his ſoul before God for his by paſt failings; and beg ſtrength for time to come, and labour to have his peace made with me. Go to him, <hi>for behold he prayeth:</hi> and therefore all you that have not a ſpirit in any meaſure to call upon God, and to powr forth your requeſts in a ſolemn prayer; you have juſt cauſe of jealouſie to ſuſpect your Call.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you are effectually call'd, God hath wrought in your ſouls, an utter deteſtation and loathing of all the evils that in the former part of your lives before you calling your have committed and were guilty of. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, what have I any more to doe with Idols?</hi> The interrogation imports a vehement deteſtation of them, and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. the Apoſtle ſpeaks there of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (the ſame with calling) when men come to have the work of grace in their hearts; and this is a branch of it; <hi>that godly ſorrow cauſeth care, and cauſeth fear, and cauſeth indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> that is, if any man be a repenting man, and a converted man; this converſion will cauſe indignation: that is, he will be even mad with himſelf, and angry with himſelf, that he ſhould be ſo vile a wretch before converſion, as he hath been. Thus was <hi>Paul,</hi> hee ſpeaks with indignation againſt the ſins he was guilty of before his calling; <hi>I have been a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor,</hi> I have hal'd the Saints into priſon; Nay, ſaith hee, <hi>I was even mad againſt the Church.</hi> Beloved, you will count your ſins to be madneſſe, and count them to be greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, that were committed before God call'd you. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelm</hi> ſaid to his body, I'le tame thee, O unruly beaſt, with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115140:25"/>and praier. We read of one that bit off his tongue in indignation, that therewith he had denied Jeſus Chriſt. Another Martyr put that hand firſt into the fire, with which he had ſubſcribed a recantation; ſaying, Burn thou, O hand, that didſt ſubſcribe to that which might have made me burn both body and ſoul in hell. And therefore you that have no loathing thoughts againſt paſt deceit, and paſt drunkenneſſe, and paſt ſwearing, and your paſt evils; ſuſpect your calling: You that do not abhor the thoughts of your former evils, your wonted pride, and wonted cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe; if you cannot looke with indignation againſt theſe, you have great cauſe to ſuſpect your call: For if God have call'd you, he will make you even angry with your ſelves, that ever you have been ſo vile as you have been. Hence it is, when God ſpeaks of <hi>Iſraels</hi> converſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.20. 'tis ſaid, <hi>they ſhall caſt away their idols from them:</hi> they ſhall caſt away their ſins as with indignation againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe they have ſinned. And hence in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.43. the Prophet tels them, that <hi>for the evils they had done, they ſhould loath themſelves in their own eyes:</hi> their indignation ſhould be ſo great againſt themſelves, that ever they ſhould be ſo vile againſt God before their call. So David with indignation ſaith, after he had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf, and brought his heart into a repentant frame, <hi>ſo fooliſh was I and ignorant, Pſal.</hi> 73.22. Now Beloved, I would here appeale unto you, I will judge no man; let your own conſciences paſs ſentence upon you; But let me appeal to your ſelves; Have not many of you before theſe times been oppoſers of Religion; men walking in ungodly, lewd, and profane courſes of living? haply now you are moulded into a form of Profeſſion; now you hear the Word, ſpeak well of Miniſters; now you cry up Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, many plauſible wayes and actions you can cary on; but what is in your hearts? Have you indignation againſt your paſt perſecution, and evils? If not beleeve it, though you go far, I fear you may come ſhort of beaven; your calling is not real, if you have not indignation and wrath againſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115140:26"/>your former ſins committed. And therefore, O what a ſad word is this to all inſenſible ſinners! that are men that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had their hearts touch'd with remorſe for any evil: What a ſad word is this to you, that have been drunk week after week; and ſworn day after day; and deceived hour after hour; and been unclean time after time; and yet all theſe evils never touch'd the heart? Truly, you have great cauſe to fear, that God hath not yet effectually called you by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The man that is effectually called, his ſpirit is brought into an obediential frame, to yeeld obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Jeſus Chriſt: if God call you by his Spirit, hee will not leave you to the exorbitancies of your own wayes and will, but he will bring you to a yeeldingneſſe of heart to all his commands. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15, 6. <hi>We have received grace and Apoſtleſhip for obedience to the faith among all Nations, among whom you are alſo the called of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle did not alone receive grace for obedience; but the ſame was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them alſo: <hi>You receive grace for the obedience of faith.</hi> So that now, if you are the called of Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord hath this work upon you, he doth bring you to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith; that is, he doth work in your ſouls a yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame to obey all the commands of Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore any of you that ſtand out with ſtoutneſſe of heart againſt Jeſus Chriſt; let Chriſt ſay what he will, you will do what you liſt; let him command what he will, you will do what you pleaſe: you that ſtand out thus with gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying of ſpirit againſt Jeſus Chriſt, you have great cauſe to ſuſpect your Call. Again,</p>
               <p n="7">7. A man effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt, he will be miſ-called and reproach'd by the men of the world: <hi>John</hi> 15.19. <hi>If you were of the world, the world would love his own; but becauſe you are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</hi> Yet do not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me; I do not ſay in this Concomitant, That every man that is reproach'd and miſ-called is a called man: but I ſay, A man that is truly called, will be miſ-called by wicked men.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115140:26"/>Now miſ-calling, or the reproaches of wicked men, is a pledg of your effectual calling, if you take in theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications: Firſt, If they miſ-call you meerly becauſe you are godly, and hate you becauſe of your holineſſe, then it is an argument: As Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Becauſe I have called you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> Secondly, If they miſ-call you when you give no occaſion of offence wherefore they may juſtly miſ-call you: If you can ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 59. <hi>They miſ-call me; but it is neither for my wickedneſſe, nor for my ſins:</hi> if they miſ-call you without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ground, then it is a probable argument of your effectual Calling.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A man effectually called, he makes it his endeavour to walk worthy of his calling: 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. So. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Walk worthy of the calling wherewith you are called.</hi> And thus I have briefly gone over theſe Eight Particulars: I intreat you, delude not your own hearts, but bring the Word and your hearts together, and trie by theſe Notes, whether you can evidence to your own ſouls, That you are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt, or no.</p>
               <p>Now is this true, That with all thoſe whom God hath effectually called, he doth take thoſe Methods before ſpoken of; and he doth work theſe Concomitants now named? Then 1. By way of <hi>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115140:27"/>of the grace of God in your calling: <hi>you are called,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.9.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>according to the purpoſe of his grace; not according to your own works.</hi> O live, live in magnifying that grace that hath called you.</p>
               <p>And here I might preſſe upon you 7 or 8 Conſiderations, why you ſhould live in magnifying of grace. I ſhal name them firſt in general. This exhortation ſhould much ſway with you, if you would conſider theſe three things, 1. From what you are called. 2. To what you are called; and 3. For what you are called. I ſhall put the two firſt together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Conſideration of this, from what, and to what you are called; ſhould much heighten your magnifying of Gods grace: And here I ſhall name ſeven particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man effectually called, he is called from ignorance to knowledg, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>You are called from darkneſſe, into marvellous light.</hi> Now ſhould not this make you magnifie mercy, that you that lay in your ſins uncalled, as in a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of darkneſſe; now God ſhould call you into a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and pleaſurable palace? thy mind was as a fair buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded houſe without windows: or if any, but woodden win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, that would let in no light; now God hath opened theſe ſhutts, and let in the Sun of righteouſneſſe to ſhine upon thy ſoul; and brought thee from this dungeon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in thy ſoul; and given thee the light of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You are called from a courſe of ſin, to a courſe of holineſſe. Before your calling you were the Divels Drudges, and did his work at will; the Divel (in <hi>Pauls</hi> language to <hi>Timothy</hi>), had you <hi>Captive at his pleaſure,</hi> but when God cals you, he takes you from under the dominion and raign of ſin; and brings you into a courſe of holineſs. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.7. <hi>You are called, not unto uncleanneſs, but unto holineſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He hath called us to glory and vertue.</hi> Before calling, thou wert the receptacle or common ſhore of all filth and uncleanneſſe; when called, thou art ſwept with the beſome of Sanctification; yea beautified and adorned as a pleaſant palace for thy God to delight in. And this ſhould cauſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115140:28"/>you much to magnifie grace, that you are brought from being the Divels drudges, to be Gods freemen; from being the Divels ſlaves, to be Gods ſervants; from being the Divels taskeman, to pay thee thy wages in hell; to be Gods workman, for which he wil give thee thy reward in heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God cals thee from bondage to libertie. In the time that thou art uncalled, thou art in bondage; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. <hi>they are the ſervants of Corruption, &amp;c.</hi> in bondage to thy luſts, and bondage to thy Paſſion, and a ſlave to the world; thou art in bondage under the Law, under the cauſe and rigour, and condemnation of it; but now Jeſus Chriſt, if he have called thee, he hath called thee to libertie. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. <hi>You are called to libertie, only uſe not libertie as a Cloak to wickedneſs.</hi> Before calling, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, you are <hi>in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans ſnares,</hi> but after calling, you are ſet at libertie, you are freed from the guilt, and freed from the bondage of your ſinne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You are called from a condition of eſtrangedneſſe, into an intimate familiaritie &amp; fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, Before <hi>calling,</hi> you are <hi>Strangers from the life of grace,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 4.18. You are <hi>without God in the world, ſtrangers to the Commonwealth of Iſrael,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12. But when God <hi>calls</hi> you, he cals you from the condition of a ſtranger, and brings you into friendſhip and fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowſhip of his Son:</hi> You who were without Chriſt before <hi>calling,</hi> being <hi>called,</hi> you enjoy neer familiaritie with his Son.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You are called from Sathan unto God. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. He hath ſent forth his word among you, <hi>to bring you from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Sathan to God.</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, who was thy lord, and was thy maſter, and ruler, thou art now from under his clutches, and brought under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and ſubjection of thy God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When God effectually calls thee, thou art brought from a ſtate of enmitie againſt God, to a ſtate of amitie and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115140:28"/>reconciliation towards him, and Jeſus Chriſt, and all the things of God. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, for to this ye are called; and be yee thankeful.</hi> God hath called you to peace, he hath not called you to wrath. Before <hi>Calling,</hi> God and thy ſoul were the moſt inveterate enemies in all the world: After <hi>Calling,</hi> God and thou are of enemies become the greateſt friends: You are called to peace, therefore be thankful.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You are called from a ſtate of ſhame to a ſtate of glory. Before you are called you are vile and ſhameful creatures in Gods ſight; when God cals you, he cals you into a condition of glory. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Who hath called us to his eternal glory:</hi> and 1 Theſ. 2.12. <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight, and I have loved thee, thou becameſt honourable,</hi> Iſa 43. 1 Pet. 2.6. <hi>To you that believe, Chriſt is precious:</hi> or as it is in the Greek,
<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>he is an honour to you.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, when once you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a believing ſtate, he is not onely precious to you, and prized of you; but he is an honour to you. This then you are to conſider, that <hi>uncalled,</hi> you are in a ſhamefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, no badg of honour lies upon you; but when once you are <hi>called</hi> by Chriſt, he becomes an honour to you.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And laſtly, (which ſhall be accompliſhed in the end) you ſhall be called from earth to heaven, and from the grave to glory; this ſhall be your call after death. Now put all theſe Eight together: To be called from ignorance to knowledg; from ſin to grace, from bondage to liberty; from eſtrangement to fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt; from a ſtate of enmitie to a ſtate of amitie and reconciliation with God and man; from ſhame to glorie; and from earth to heaven: and ſhould not this mightily highten your joy, and greaten your praiſes in magnifying the grace of God in your hearts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Again, The conſideration of this, As, <hi>From what,</hi> and <hi>To what;</hi> ſo, <hi>For what you are called,</hi> ſhould grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your praiſes. Now <hi>for what</hi> are you called? You are called meerly according to the <hi>purpoſe of his owne grace;</hi> neither foreſeen works, nor good education, nor grace in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115140:29"/>you, none of all theſe were motives in Gods breſt to call you. And hence you may ſee it was nothing in you, becauſe there were many things in us might move God not to call us: We have often withſtood his call; we have often ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled the motions of his Spirit in our hearts; we have often carried gain ſaying hearts to the wooings of the Miniſters of Chriſt: So that it is nothing in us, but meerly his own grace that conquers our unholineſſe, and conquers our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe, and overcomes that ſtoutneſſe of heart that is in us; meerly the grace and goodneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt. Now ſumm up all theſe together, and revolve them in your hearts, and you will ſee what great cauſe you have to live in magnifying of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>In the handling of which, I have gone over ſeveral particulars: I now come to laie down ſome Propoſitions or Concluſions about <hi>Effectuall calling,</hi> and I ſhall name <hi>twenty</hi> in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Ten ſad Concluſions to all thoſe men who are not effectually called.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:115140:29"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ten conſolatorie Concluſions to all thoſe men that are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt; and mixing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions procuring terror to the wicked, with ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure comfort to the godly; one tempered with the other may do good to both. I begin with the firſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt ſad Concluſion I ſhal lay down is this; That there are many men in the world, that are called outwardly by the word unto a profeſſion of Chriſt, that are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led effectually by the ſpirit to a poſſeſſion of Chriſt. My meaning is this; There are many men have the word of God working much upon them, to the changing of their lives, altering their courſe, and new moulding of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an external profeſſion; that yet notwithſtanding all this never had ſaving grace wrought upon their hearts, which is effectual calling: <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.16. And this is a dreadful Concluſion to all you that are profeſſors, that have not a ſaving work upon your hearts; to you that flock unto the miniſtry of the word, yet are not called thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they who are called outwardly by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word to a profeſſion of Chriſt, and yet not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led inwardly by the ſpirit, they ſhall endure greater dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and greater torments in hell, then thoſe that never heard a word of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8 12. <hi>Many ſhall come</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, and ſhal ſit down with Abraham, Iſaak, and Jacob, in the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> and what then? <hi>but the children of the Kingdome ſhall be caſt out into utter darkneſſe, where ſhall be weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Now, who are meant here by the children of the kingdome? not thoſe that have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven prepared for them; but the profeſſing Jewes, who are called the children of the kingdome, becauſe they enjoyed a greater, and clearer, and fuller meaſure of the things of God, which ſhewed them the way to the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then other men did. And when Chriſt cals them the children of the kingdome, he cals the heathen the children of the world. Now, many of the children of the kingdome
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115140:30"/>ſhall be caſt into utter darkneſſe: If there be any more diſmal place then other, it ſhall be for the children of the kingdome; thoſe that have been as it were nurſed up under Gods elbow by ordinances; the children of the kingdome, they ſhall have a more diſmal portion, and diſmal room in hell then other men ſhall have, that never enjoyed the ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt. And O what a ſad word is this to you that live where ordinances do moſt abound, that you may be called the children of the kingdome, and yet you to be thruſt into utter darkneſſe!</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there are many men, who are only called out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly into a bare profeſſion, that do harbour and nouriſh preſumptuous perſwaſions in their own hearts, that they are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt; when they never had any ſaving work of grace upon their hearts. This I ſpake of ſome weeks agoe, from <hi>John.</hi> 8.41. The Jewes had ſtrong perſwaſions, they had <hi>Abraham</hi> for their father; and when Chriſt beats them off from that, they went higher and ſaid, we have God to our father; and yet <hi>verſe</hi> 44. Chriſt tels them, <hi>they were of their Father the Divell.</hi> And Beloved, you may alſo be deceived, in harbouring ſtrong perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that you are called effectually, when you are only call'd outwardly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That they that are conceited in the opinion of their own goodneſſe, without ſeeing their want and neceſſitie of Jeſus Chriſt; are of all ſorts of people in the world moſt unlikely to be effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt. This I urge from <hi>Matt.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I came not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>to call the righteous,</hi> &amp;c. Mark, who are they? that is, Chriſt came not to call the Phariſees, who were righteous in their own eyes, and who had a ſelfe conceitedneſſe that things went well with them; and ſaw no need of a Mediator, and Interceſſor, and Redeemer; <hi>I came not to call the righteous:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that ſort of men from being called by him; men that are ſelf opinionated, and have a conceit of their own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without any want of Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore all you that think you have a ſtrong faith towards God ever
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115140:30"/>ſince you were born, that think you live honeſtly among your neighbours, pay every man his due, and therefore ſee no need of Chriſt all your daies; the Lord ſhew you mercie; you are more unlikly to be called then any men in the world. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31. There is a parable <hi>of a man that had two ſons, hee bid both work in the vineyard; one ſon ſaid he would not work,</hi> he was obſtinate; <hi>the other ſon ſaid he would work, but did not,</hi> and ſo was worſe then his word. Now theſe two ſons, they are the emblem of two ſorts of men within the pale of the Church; ſome are profane and obſtinate men, and they anſwer as the firſt ſon, and ſay, they wil not work: the ſecond are profeſſing men, men that make a good profeſſion, but do not anſwer their profeſſion in their practice. Now marke; <hi>Whether of theſe twain will the father accept? and they ſaid unto him, the firſt,</hi> the moſt obſtinate; that ſaid, he would not go, but went. <hi>Verily,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſo I ſay unto you, Publicans and Harlots ſhall go into heaven before you.</hi> Mark, how Chriſt applies the parable from their own mouths; you that are Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, that are righteous and honeſt in your own eyes, I wil ſooner call whores, and harlots, and the worſt of men, then I wil call you. <hi>Publicans and Harlots;</hi> Publicans, they were the worſt ſort of men that were, they were ſitting at the receipt of cuſtome, their calling expoſing them to a great deal of extortion and briberie, yet theſe men ſhould go to heaven before others that made a glorious profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Jeſus Chriſt. Again,</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth ſad Concluſion is this, That when others are effectually called before your faces, and yet you remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, this ſhould greatly aggravate your ſin and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; when (I ſay) you ſhall ſee others that live (haply) in the ſame houſe with you, that hear in the ſame congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that ſit in the ſame ſeat with you; when you ſhall hear theſe effectually called, and you remain uncalled; this ſhall greatly increaſe your ſin &amp; damnation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.32. <hi>John came to you in the way of righteouſneſſe, and you beleeved him not;</hi> (that is, they were not called by his Miniſtry)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115140:31"/>what then? <hi>but the Publicans and Harlots believed:</hi> what then? <hi>and you, when you had ſeen it, repented not afterwards that you might believe:</hi> Mark how Chriſt argues, he urges, that thoſe men that heard the ſame Sermons that the other men did heare, they were converted; ſaith he, you ſee whores and harlots converted, (alluding to <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and others) you ſee theſe, and yet you repent not, and yet you beleeve not: now you ſee one, then another; and yet when you ſee this, you repent not that you might beleeve. Beloved, This is a ſad concluſion to you, that ſhall ſee others converted, when you that haply lie in the ſame bed, ſit at the ſame board, and hear the ſame Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the ſame Congregation; yet they ſhall be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and called, and you not: this will greatly increaſe your ſin and condemnation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That whoever God intends effectually to call, it is Gods ordinary way to call them by the Miniſtry of his word. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. Its ſaid there, that they were <hi>called through the Sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternall glory by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> they were called by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the truth, that is, by believing the word preacht, and loving the word preacht; <hi>faith comes by hearing:</hi> faith is the firſt grace in a Chriſtians Call, and that comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 26.17, 18. When Chriſt would call and convert the Gentiles, he doth it not immediately, but he uſeth the Miniſtry of <hi>Paul: God thou, teach the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and bring them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> God doth it ſtill by the preaching of his word. Now this is a ſad word to three ſorts of men. Firſt, its a ſad word to them that never ſat under the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preaching of the word, they are out of Gods ordinarie way of being ſaved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a ſad word to thoſe that may enjoy the word, and yet ſlight it; they alſo are not likely to be called.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its a ſad word to thoſe that leave the ordinarie way of Gods calling by the preaching of the word, and truſt to raptures, revelations, inſpirations, and extraordinary
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115140:31"/>means for God to call them by: alas, they alſo are out of Gods ordinarie way of calling, for God ordinarily takes this way to call a ſoul by the preaching of his word. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.22. When the Prodigal was effectually called home to his father, his father did not preſently comfort him himſelf, but he ſends his ſervants, and ſaid, <hi>Go, take the beſt robe, and put it upon my Sonne;</hi> This ſon is a ſinner, the father is God Almightie, the ſervants are the miniſters; now God doth not his work by himſelf, but he leaves it to his Miniſters; and they ſhall put on the ring and the garment; they ſhall be the inſtruments by the Miniſtrie of the word to work grace in the heart. Hence 'tis that 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 1.12. Some are blamed that ſhould ſay, <hi>I am of Paul, and I of Apollo and I of Chriſt;</hi> Why, are men blamed for ſaying they are for Chriſt? Is that blame worthy, to cry up Chriſt? No: the fault is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in advancing Chriſt, but the fault was this, ſo to cry up Chriſt, as to crie down duties, and crie down the uſe of Miniſters, and the uſe of ordinances, and therein they were to blame; becauſe Chriſt would not immediately by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and raptures call any, but leaves the converſion and call of a ſinner, to the ordinary way of preaching the word: and therefore a ſad word it is to all out of Gods way of calling, that either have not the word, or if they have it, never care to enjoy it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That if men continue long under the enjoyment of the word, and are not effectually called by it, they are likely never to be called. I would commend to you that place to prove this, in <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6, 7. where Chriſt tels you <hi>of a fig tree, he ſtayed three years looking for fruit, and he found none; the husbandman prayed to ſpare it one yeare longer, and if it did not bear fruit then, he ſhould cut it down, and caſt it into the fire.</hi> Now, this fig tree were the profeſſing Jewes, who lay ſome competent time under the Miniſtrie of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles; and this fig-tree, if it were ſpared but one year, and brought not forth fruit, then it ſhould be cut down: and Chriſt did ſo, it ſeems he curſt it, and ſaid, <hi>never fruit grow more upon this tree.</hi> Now, you would ask
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115140:32"/>what the meaning of all this is? Why, Beloved, a fig-tree, if it beareth not fruit within four yeares after it is planted, it is likely never to bring forth fruit: And here the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comes home thus far, that if after ſome competencie of time, in which in all likelihood, men may have ſome ſparkes wrought in them by the miniſtrie of the word; if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this they are not converted, the curſe of the fig-tree is like to fall upon that mans heart; never let word do that man good more, and never let grace grow in that mans heart more; <hi>let never fruit grow more upon that tree;</hi> this the Parable holds forth, that if you live under the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the word long, and are not converted, it is an argument you ſhall not be called. And this is a heart-cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting conſideration to all ancient men, that have out-lived many Miniſters, and have ſeen their Miniſters laid in the Grave; their Miniſters have ſpent their ſtrength, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted their lungs in preaching to them; and yet they are as profane as ever, and as looſe as ever, and as regardleſs of God and grace as ever; truely, you are in a very ſad caſe if it be thus with you, you are likely never to be called by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That God in the diſpenſations of his grace, doth not ordinarily let effectual calling run to the richer ſort of men in the world;
<note place="margin">Surgunt indocti &amp; rapiunt coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum; &amp; nos cum doctri nis noſtris detrudimur in Geh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</note> but rather to the pooreſt ſorts and ranks of men that are. I remember <hi>Auſtin</hi> in one of his books hath this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Unlearned men, they ſnatch away heaven from us that are great Scholars: and truely, as it was in his time, ſo it is now: Men that are great Scholars, that underſtand Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, know languages; they are turned into hel, when unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and poor men, they get heaven. <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this world to be rich in faith.</hi> In all the diſpenſations of his grace; (though he cals ſome rich men, it is true, to carrie on the work, and countenance his people; yet) Gods effectuall calling doth not ſo commonly come among rich men, as the poor of the world: <hi>the poor,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Goſpel;</hi> the learned Scribes, and Doctors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jewes, and the rich Phariſees, they did all ſpurn
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115140:32"/>at Jeſus Chriſt; when the poor and ignorant people that knew not the law, they followed him. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 26. <hi>Not many wiſe, not many noble, not many mighty are called; but God hath choſen the poor things of this world, and things that are deſpiſed, yea, and things that are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi> Here you ſee plainly this Concluſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Gods effectuall calling doth not ordinarily and commonly run among the greater ſort of men in the world; but it runs among the poorer ſort of men, they ordinarily give beſt entertainment to the Goſpel. And the reaſon of this is, 1. To magnifie the riches of his grace; if Chriſt ſhould call rich men only, and chiefly; many would think, it was only mens riches, and mens honour did move Chriſt to call them: Now, Chriſt to vindicate and magnifie his grace, he will call poor deſpicable wretches, that one would think, there ſhould be nothing in the eye of reaſon or ſenſe, why God ſhould caſt an eye of favour upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To magnifie and manifeſt his power, that he will preſerve a companie of poor contemptible people, among ſo many enemies, ſo potent, and ſo wealthie, that they ſhall never be able to overthrow them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe, rich men lie under more temptations againſt effectuall calling, then poor men do. Rich men thinke, ſhould I be called to be a Profeſſor, I may loſe my riches, endanger my eſtate, and eclipſe my honour; and theſe are great temptations to rich men to hinder their calling. Therefore you read <hi>Mark</hi> 10.22. of the young man; that when Chriſt called him, it is ſaid, <hi>he went away ſorrowfull, for he had great poſſeſſions;</hi> and would not follow Chriſt, who had not a houſe wherein to put his head. Many men for fear of loſing their eſtates, they lie under this ſore temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to hinder them from being called: And then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for their honour; men may think they ſhall eclipſe their honor, ſhould they profeſs a courſe of Religion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I preacht publikely among the ordinarie ſort,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, but</hi> I preach <hi>privately to men of reputation, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt I ſhould run in vair.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, men of qualitie
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115140:33"/>and of repute, they would not own Chriſt publickly, they were affraid they ſhould loſe their honour and credit; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> was enforc'd to indulge them ſo far, as to preach privately to them; hence <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a great man came to Jeſus by night.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If you are only externally called to a profeſſion of Chriſt, and not called internally to a poſſeſſion of him; at one time or other before you die, God will diſcover the hypocrifie of your hearts, and the unſoundneſs of your Call. There are many men who now are called; a man cannot diſcern whether they be effectually called or no; but in likelihood before you die, you will diſcover ſomewhat or other that may give juſt ground of ſuſpicion, you are not ſavingly called; either by falling into ſome error in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or running into ſome ſcandalous ſin, or the like.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If God hath not, or intends not effectually to call thee, thou maieſt take this for an undeniable truth, God neither intends to juſtifie thee, nor to ſave thee: <hi>whom he cals, them he juſtifies,</hi> and none elſe; <hi>and whom he juſtifies, them he glorifies,</hi> and none elſe: So that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Glorification depends upon calling; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. And thus I have done with theſe ten ſad Concluſions.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now change my diſcourſe, and turn my ſpeech to a ſecond ſort of men; and to them I ſhall lay down ten conſolatory Concluſions, for the comfort of you that are the called of Jeſus Chriſt. And here, before I lay theſe down, I ſhall firſt ſhew you what need there is that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould preach comfortably to you that are effectually called. Becauſe firſt, after you are called effectually, you are more expoſed to meet with perſecutions from men. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Temptations from the Divel. Thirdly, The ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtrugling of Corruptions from within, then ever you were before; therefore you had need of comfort.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, After calling you are more expoſed to meet with perſecutions from men, then ever you were before. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32, 33. <hi>Call to remembrance the former daies, in which after you were illuminated, you endured a ſore fight of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115140:33"/>affliction, partly by being reproached, and made a gazing ſtock &amp;c.</hi> They endured nothing before, but after they were inlightned, they endured a great fight of Affliction: had not you therefore need of comfort?</p>
               <p n="2">2. After Calling, you are more expoſed to temptations from the Divel, then ever you were before. The Divel, when he finds all things at peace, he lets men alone; but when he finds a man coming out of his clutches to be called, then Satan troubles and aſſaults him. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8, 10. <hi>Your Adverſarie the Divel goes about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> Theſe were they that <hi>the God of grace had called to eternall glory.</hi> Yet theſe were they that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel rageth ſo againſt; Had not you therfore need of comfort, becauſe you are expoſed to more Temptations from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel?</p>
               <p>And 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, You are to meet with more ſtrong and vigorous workings of inward Corruptions in your own hearts; as <hi>Paul,</hi> before his calling was not troubled with his Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſinne never troubled him; the powerful and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous workings of his luſts never wearied him; <hi>but when the command came, then ſin revived:</hi> When the power of the word came with Authoritie upon his Conſcience, then he ſaw ſinne to revive and get ſtrength upon him. Beloved, I would appeal to any of you, whom God hath called to grace and glory, whether before you were called, you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found ſinne ſo ſtrong as after, and ever found the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of your inward corruptions ſo violent as after? and therefore upon theſe three grounds, you have need that comfort ſhould be preached unto you.</p>
               <p>I now paſſe to the Concluſions, which I ſhall lay down for the comfort of all them that are effectually called.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Jeſus Chriſt doth effectually call a poor ſinner, before that ſinner doth look after Jeſus Chriſt. Should God intail heaven upon this condition, that you that had been firſt in the tranſgreſſion, ſhould be firſt in ſeeking reconciliation, we ſhould never have the difference ended betwixt God and us; but behold, here is mercy, and here
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115140:34"/>is a ground of Comfort, that though we are the firſt in the tranſgreſſion; Chriſt is the firſt in ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng out Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation: Jeſus Chriſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th effectually call poor ſinners, before they either call or look after Jeſus Chriſt at all. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for me, I am found of them that ſought me not; I ſaid, Behold me, Behold me, to a Nation that was not called by my name.</hi> Here you ſee, Jeſus Chriſt goeth out firſt to call thee, before thou goeſt out to call him. And O what comfort is this? Chriſt doth not ſtay till thou look after a Chriſt; but Chriſt caſts an eye upon thee before thou look after him. We read of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> the Publican, that while he was looking after his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at the receipt of cuſtome, at that time Jeſus Chriſt was looking after his ſoul. We read of the Diſciples of Chriſt, whilſt they were mending their nets, and looking after their fiſh, Jeſus Chriſt takes this occaſion with the Hook of the Goſpel to catch them. We read of <hi>Paul,</hi> that whilſt he was breathing out perſecution againſt the Church of God, and raging with malice againſt the Saints of God; at that time he was even called to be a Saint: So that this is very comfortable. God doth firſt look after a ſinner in his effectual calling, before a ſinner looks out after Chriſt. God doth firſt look after thee, inlightning thee by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſeizing upon thy conſcience by a command, before thou look after him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Jeſus Chriſt hath effectually called thee, when he hath left many thouſands in the world, of better parts, and better diſpoſitions, more naturall good, and leſs evill in them then thou haſt in thy ſelf; and yet he hath reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them and called thee. Jeſus Chriſt hath many times rejected a patient heathen, when he hath called thee, who art of a paſſionate and rigid diſpoſition. Jeſus Chriſt hath left many a curious wit, and pregnant Scholar, and many of ſingular parts that had they grace to manage them, they might bring God much glory; and it may be he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee, a poor ignorant ſottiſh creature. Jeſus Chriſt (it may be) hath rejected many that have had leſs
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115140:34"/>ſinne, then thou haſt in thee. Jeſus Chriſt did reject ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an honeſt heathen, when he would call <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> that had ſeven Divels in her; Chriſt rejected <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and rejected <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a half turned Chriſtian; and rejected <hi>Herod,</hi> who heard <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt gladly; and rejected <hi>Felix,</hi> that trembled at a Sermon; and rejected <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> that humbled his ſoul before God; when it may be, he hath called thee, that never hadſt ſuch workings in thy heart as theſe men had: and O what ground of comfort is here?</p>
               <p n="3">3. God in calling thy ſoul, and bringing thee into a ſtate of grace, he doth it freely for his own names ſake; when there was nothing in thee to move him to call thee; when there was much in thee to provoke him never to call thee; yet his own grace compelled him, and his own mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him to cal thee. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. <hi>We are called according to the purpoſe of his own grace, not according to our own works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That they who are moſt ſenfible of their own vileneſs, and ſee the moſt want and neceſſity of Jeſus Chriſt; they of all people are moſt likely to be called by him. When Chriſt rejects civil honeſt men, and ſelf conceited men, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good men, and they are no way likely to be called; yet thoſe men that are ſenſible of their wickedneſſe, and ſee their want of Jeſus Chriſt, they are of all men moſt likely to be called. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I came not to call the righteous,</hi> but whom? <hi>but ſinners to repentance.</hi> All men are ſinners, but he means ſuch as ſee their ſin, and ſee their need of Chriſt to pardon and ſubdue ſin in them; for ſo the words import: <hi>The whole need not a Phyſician, but they that are ſick:</hi> They that are ſick of ſin and ſee their infirmities, they are moſt likely to be called by Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore this is moſt comfortable to you, all you that are drooping Chriſtians, that hang down your heads under the ſenſe of ſin, that ſee ſin to be exceeding ſinful; this is the end for which Chriſt came into the world, to call you to glory.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That a man may be elected by God from all eternity, and yet he may live a long time in a courſe of ſin, before he call him, and yet before he dies, he ſhall be called. <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:115140:35"/>10.16. <hi>I laie down my life for my ſheep; and other ſheep I have, which are not of this fold, them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my voice, and there ſhall be one fold under one ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning is this; Chriſt told them, his converted ones were his ſheep; and theſe are not all; but I have others that are not converted, yet I will convert them, and bring them to the ſame fold alſo. So that Chriſt hath his ſheep among them that are not yet converted and called; and though many times you you may go a long time in a courſe of ſin, yet before you die, you ſhall be effectually called, and brought home to the ſheepfold of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A man may be effectually called, when in his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, he cannot find any real and ſound evidence of his vocation. This that Phraſe in <hi>Peter</hi> imports, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Whoſo doth not theſe things, is blind and cannot ſee afar off.</hi> It is ſpoken of a godly man, of a man that hath his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure, but doth not adde grace to grace to make his calling ſure, that man is purblind and cannot ſee afar off; that is, cannot ſee as far as heaven, that his name is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there; cannot have clear and ſtrong comfort of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to God. Many a godly man, may be effectually called, and yet that man a purblind man, not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold as with open face the evidence of his effectuall calling.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A man may have a grounded aſſurance that he is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, and yet neither know the time when, nor the manner how, nor the inſtrument by whom he was called. And this is a very comfortable Concluſion. There are ſome that preſs converſion ſo high, that if a man cannot tell the time when, or the manner how, or the Sermon by which he was called, they ſay that he is not yet converted; this is too rigid a Doctrine; and the Scripture makes more for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this, that a man may have a grounded aſſurance of his effectuall calling, when he neither knows the time, nor the manner, nor the inſtrument, by which he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.27. <hi>And he ſaid, ſo is the Kingdome of God, as if a man ſhould caſt ſeed into the ground, and ſhould ſleep,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115140:35"/>and riſe night and day, and the ſeed ſhould ſpring up and grow he knows not how.</hi> The ſeed here ſown, is the work of grace; <hi>for ſo is the Kingdom of God,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: and here this ſeed ſprings up; the man cannot tell haply the day he ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, nor how he ſcattered it; yet this ſeed ſprings up he knows not how. So a man may have the ſeed of grace ſown in his heart, which is effectuall calling, and yet it grows up he knows not how, nor when he was called. So <hi>John</hi> 9. (I only allude to it) 19, 20. It is ſpoken there of the man that was healed by Jeſus Chriſt; the blind Sonne, that had his eyes opened by Jeſus Chriſt: What ſay his Parents? <hi>We know this is our ſon, and that he was born blind; but by what means he now ſeeth we know not, nor who opened his eyes.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, So I may ſay of a poor ſinner; a poor ſinner is like this blind ſonne, we know we are born blind, neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God nor our ſelves. We know, if we are converted, we now ſee, but how this was done, or by whom this was done, man cannot ſo exactly determine.</p>
               <p>But now, this Concluſion doth not hold true in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if a man have been a profane liver; then it is impoſſible in an ordinarie way, that that man ſhould be effectually called, but he muſt know the time when he is called: but for others that from their childhood have been brought up in a godly familie, and from their child-hood to their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, did never break out into any ſcandalous ſinne; theſe men cannot give an account either when, or by whom they were called, and yet their calling may be effectuall: and therfore that is too rigid a Doctrine, to preſs ſuch heights Qualifications before converſion; for God hath different wayes and degrees of working, though all are not obvious to our eye.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That they who are called by Chriſt, they ſhall be kept by Chriſt, that they do not fall from their Call, but be brought to the ſtate of glory, and that's another comfortable concluſion: you are not called by Chriſt, and ſo left to your ſelves and the wide world, as <hi>Adam</hi> was. <hi>Adam</hi> was called by God to a ſtate of bleſſedneſſe, but he was left to ſtand by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115140:36"/>his own ſtrength, but you are not ſo: You are not only called by Chriſt, but you are kept by Chriſt, that you ſhall not fall from grace, being once called to it. <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 1. <hi>Jude the ſervant of Chriſt, to them that are ſanctified by God the Father, preſerved in Chriſt and called.</hi> Here then is your comfort, that you are not called by Chriſt, and left to your ſelves; but you are preſerv'd by Chriſt, and called and kept in a ſtate of grace, till you ſhall come to glory.

Not your impiety; poor Chriſtians think, Oh, I am ſo vile, and ſo ſinful, and profane, that I fear Chriſt will not cal me: Why, this ſhall not hinder; <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, poſſeſſed with ſeven Divels, yet called; <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> a blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucker, that made the ſtreets of Jeruſalem run down with blood, yet called; <hi>Paul</hi> a perſecuter, a blaſphemer, a man mad with rage againſt the Church of God, <hi>yet he obtained mercy;</hi> and why? <hi>that he might be an example to them that after ſhould be called.</hi> So that here is your comfort, when Jeſus Chriſt hath an intent to call you, neither your Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor your Impietie ſhall withſtand his call, nor turn the thoughts of his mercy from you.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Doctrine I am yet upon in the proſecution of theſe words, is this, <hi>That Chriſtians ſhould put forth a great deal of diligence to make this ſure to their ſouls, that they are effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In the managing of which, I laid down the laſt Lords day twenty Propoſitions; ten in relation to wicked men not called, and ten concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the comfort of them that are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt. I am now to proceed in the diſpatch of ſix ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of conſcience, which I ſhall handle about effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Three of which concern men not effectually called, and three touching Believers, who are called by Chriſt to grace here, and to hopes of glory in the world to come.</p>
               <p>The three firſt caſes touching wicked men are theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether a wicked man be able to reſiſt his own call?</p>
               <p>Secondly, What temptations doth the Devil ſuggeſt, to keep a wicked man from entertaining and embracing the call of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What deluſions doth the Devil uſe to deceive Hypocrites, to make them preſumptuouſly believe, that they are effectually called, when they are not?</p>
               <p>There are three caſes more touching godly men: As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether may a man that is effectually called, be any way aſſured that he is ſo?</p>
               <p>Secondly, If a man may be aſſured, then what is the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115140:37"/>reaſon many a godly man is not aſſured of his effectual calling?</p>
               <p>And then Thirdly, How may he come to get the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his effectual calling? I begin with the firſt, about wicked men that are not called; and the caſe is this,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether may a wicked man, a man as yet not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, be able to reſiſt and keep off his own cal?</p>
               <p>And that you may underſtand the anſwer hereto, I muſt lay down this diſtinction; That there is a twofold calling of Chriſt:</p>
               <p>A Significative calling, and an operative calling.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Significative calling, which is ſuch a calling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt in the Miniſtry of the word, ſignifies and declares what he would have men to do: Now this kind of call, wicked men may reſiſt; this call, I ſay, and this revealed will of God, in declaring what graces he would have men act, and what ſins he would have men forbear: Therefore we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.5. <hi>You ſtiff-necked people, and uncircumciſed in heart and eares, you have alwayes reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> meaning the Preaching of the word, by the Miniſtry of his Apoſtles. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. <hi>I have called, and ye have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then Secondly, There is an Operative calling, and that is ſuch a call, whereby God doth not onely ſignifie to a man what he muſt do, but with the ſignification of his will, gives a man a power to do what he calls him to do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the word with his Spirit, making the heart ſtoop and yeeld to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now this cal no man can reſiſt; Grace is irreſiſtable; and this effectual calling by the operation of the Spirit, a man cannot reſiſt. All the gain-ſayings of the heart, and all the ſtoutneſſe of the will it muſt ſtoop, and muſt be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given me, ſaith Chriſt, ſhall come unto me.</hi> They ſhal not be able to withſtand Jeſus Chriſt, but they ſhal come in unto him. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.10. <hi>As the rain comes down, and the ſnow from Heaven, and returns not thither again, but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115140:37"/>waters the earth, to make it bring forth, ſo ſhall my word be that goes out of my mouth, it ſhall not return in vain; but ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh that which I intended, and it ſhall proſper in the thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I ſent it.</hi> As all the world cannot hinder the rain from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down on the earth, no more can any man in the world, if God hath an intent to convert and call him, hinder the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the word from redounding upon his ſoul.</p>
               <p>Now the anſwering of this caſe thus briefly, will admit of a double Uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Firſt, an Uſe of Condemnation to wicked men,  that have often reſiſted the ſignificative call of Jeſus Chriſt. When Chriſt hath ſignified, this is my will, I would have you leave theſe courſes, and I would have you walk in theſe wayes; Chriſt ſignifies his will in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; yet let Chriſt ſignifie what he will, you will do what you liſt; this is for thy great condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Secondly, The anſwering of this <hi>Query,</hi>  is for conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to elect men, who are not yet converted. Doſt thou belong to Gods Election? Why, before thou art convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou haſt a ſtubborn wil, thou haſt a gainſaying heart, thou haſt a ſtout ſpirit againſt God, thy heart is as hard as an Adamant, as hard as the Rocks; yet here is thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, all the gain-ſayings of thy ſpirit, and all the ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy will, it ſhall not be able to keep off converting mercy, and ſhall not be able to keep off calling grace from thee: When God hath an intent to call thee, he will come with Power by his call, and make thee do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thee, and make thee imbrace what he cals thee to. Did not Jeſus Chriſt uſe an operative call, as well as a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative call, no man in the world would ever be called. And this is the reaſon, that in hearing the ſame Sermon, and following the ſame Preacher, one man is converted, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not. The reaſon is this, The call of the Miniſtry is onely a ſignificative call of a Reprobate; onely ſignifying what God would have him do: But there is no power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed with the invitation, to make the man able to do what Chriſt cals him to; and therefore one is called, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115140:38"/>is not. Thus much in Anſwer to the firſt caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe. </seg>2</label> Secondly,  What temptations doth the Devil ſuggeſt to men, who are uncalled, that they ſhould not give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to, or embrace the call of Jeſus Chriſt unto grace and glory? And in anſwer to this, I ſhall lay down onely four ſuggeſtions of the Devil, wherewith he entangles a man, that he ſhould not yeeld to the call of Jeſus Chriſt. And as I lay them down, I ſhall labour to take them away. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt temptation the Devil will ſuggeſt, is to you that are young men; and to you he will ſuggeſt, that you are yet too young to imbrace the call of Jeſus Chriſt, 'twill be time enough hereafter, and you may do it ſoon enough hereafter; you are too young now to be abridg'd of your pleaſure, and to mortifie your luſts, and to betake your ſelves unto ſo ſerious a courſe as Chriſt cals you to: and by this temptation, the Devil prevails with young men more eſpecially. And I remember <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, that this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil, made him keep off for ſeven years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from embracing the call of Jeſus Chriſt; the Devil would ſtill tell him in his heart, thou art too young to leave thy Drunkenneſſe, and too young to leave thy Harlots; till at laſt he cryed out, How long ſhall I ſay, it is too ſoon? Why may I not repent to day? This temptation I ſay, it hath faſtened upon many before you, that they were too young to come in to Jeſus Chriſt; and to this end, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will ſuggeſt to you that old and falſe Proverb, <hi>A young Saint, and an old Devil:</hi> Whereas indeed, if you are young Devils, you will be old <hi>Beelzebubs.</hi> And therefore this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſuggeſtion, prevailing with many hearts, I ſhall lay down ſix conſiderations, to take off this temptation, that it may not prevail with you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If the Devil tempt you, that you are yet too yong to hearken to Chriſts call, conſider, That the Devil cannot give you a Leaſe of your lives; if the Devil could give you a Leaſe of your lives, and tell you, you ſhould live till old age, you might then with more ſafety hearken to his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but your lives are not at the Devils diſpoſal, God is the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115140:38"/>Author of your life; the iſſues of life, and death are in his hands; you may dye in youth, and if you die in youth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, you may be damned, as well as dead. You may be as theſe men, <hi>Job</hi> 36.14. <hi>That ſhall dye in their youth, and their lives ſhall be among the unclean.</hi> And therefore though the Devil tempt you, that you are too young, ſeeing he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſure you of your lives, you have no reaſon to hearken to his temptation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe the Devil could aſſure you, you ſhould live till old age; yet take this conſideration, that in putting off your calling, and the work of converſion from your youth, this may ſo provoke God, that he may harden your hearts in your old dayes, that you ſhall have no heart to think of, and imbrace the call and invitation of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. <hi>I ſpake to thee in thy proſperity, but thou wouldſt not hear, and this hath been thy manner from thy youth; Thou wouldſt not obey my voyce.</hi> God ſpake, but they would not hear, and it was from their youth that they did thus; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would never ſpeak more: God hardened their hearts, that they ſhould never receive or imbrace the call of Jeſus Chriſt. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9.10. Seeing the Jewes from their youth were obſtinate againſt the word of God, <hi>Go,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>make their ears heavy, and their hearts fat, and their eyes blind, that they ſhould not be called, and converted, and I ſhould ſave them.</hi> Let this therefore be a ſecond conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the putting off your call till your old age, may ſo provoke God, as never to give you hearts to imbrace his call.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Suppoſe all this, that you could have a Leaſe of your lives, and you could be aſſured, that when you come to old age, your hearts ſhould not be hardened; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, that the more ſinful and evil the dayes of your youth have been, the more diſquietneſs of mind, and horror of conſcience will this breed in you when you are old, though you ſhould be called, and converted by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Job.</hi> 13.24, 25, 26. <hi>Thou hideſt thy face, thou holdeſt me as thy Enemy. Thou doſt drive me as a leaf to and fro, and thou doſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115140:39"/>purſue me like dry ſtubble.</hi> Now why doth <hi>Job</hi> complain thus? Mark the next words, <hi>For thou writeſt bitter things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſs the iniquities of my youth. Job,</hi> when he was a young man, it ſeems he was a wicked man, and had many ſins in his youth, and this in his old age made him cry out, and ſay, that God took him for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that God brake him like a leaf driven with the wind. O beloved, the ſins of your youth, though you ſhould be <hi>Jobs,</hi> converted, yet they wil bring great diſquietneſs, and great horror, when you come to age; the luſts of youth, and the vanities of youth, and the ſenſual pleaſures of your youthful dayes, they will lay a foundation of ſorrow, when you come to gray hairs, to be neare your graves; ſo <hi>Job</hi> 20.11. And therefore, put the caſe you ſhould repent, and ſhould be called when you are old, you have no cauſe to put off the call of Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeing ſins of youth will fill you with horror and diſquietneſs of mind. Hence it is, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> after he was call'd by the power of the word, cryes out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. <hi>Lord, remember not the ſins of my youth;</hi> that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled and gall'd his conſcience, the ſins of his youth before his call.
<note place="margin">Quae fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt inaenia juventut is gaudia, haec ſunt acerba ſenectutis gravamina.</note> It is the ſpeech of an Author, that to look on the pleaſurable vanities and contents of youth, this will become an heavy burden, and bitter vexation in old age. Beloved, the more evil you run out into in your youthful daies, the greater and deeper foundation of diſquietneſſe and ſorrow you lay in your ſouls in your latter daies; though you ſhould be called by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Devil ſuggeſt, that you are too young to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the invitation of Chriſt: conſider, That Jeſus Chriſt will take it moſt kindly at your hands, if while you are young you will give intertainment to his call, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I remember thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and the kindneſs of thy youth, that thou wouldſt follow me in the Wilderneſs, in a Land that was not ſown.</hi> Mark how the Lord ſpeaks, and how kindly he takes it, that they would in their youth follow God; the Lord will remember it, and take it acceptably from you, if while you are young, while the Marrow is in your bones, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115140:39"/>ſtrength in your joynts, you will imbrace the wayes of Jeſus Chriſt. It is an obſervation that ſome have, concerning the beloved Diſciple <hi>John,</hi> John 20. <hi>He is called the Diſciple whom Chriſt loved, and that leaned upon his breſt;</hi> of all the other eleven Diſciples, Chriſt did love <hi>John</hi> above the reſt; and Divines give this reaſon of it, <hi>John</hi> was the youngeſt of all the Diſciples, he was converted and called by Chriſt, when he was a young man; and Chriſt ſeeing a young man follow him, took this very kindly at his hands, and cals him his beloved Diſciple. As you that are Parents, you let your little Children ſit in your lap, when your great ones ſhall not; ſo <hi>John,</hi> he being a young man, Chriſt would let him lean upon his breſt, and lie in his boſome, expreſſing his kindneſſe to him.</p>
               <p>Now, O how ſhould this beat off this temptation that you are too young to follow Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt takes it ſo kindly at your hands, if you imbrace his call in time: nay, Chriſt doth take it ſo kindly, that he doth love bare Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Civility in young men; and therefore it is ſaid in <hi>Matthew,</hi> when Chriſt ſaw the young man, and he told him,
<note place="margin">Matt. 19.20</note> 
                  <hi>I have obſerved theſe things from my youth, Chriſt look'd upon him, and loved him:</hi> Chriſt ſhewed a general love to the young man, that was but a Moral man from his youth; and if Chriſt love Morality, he will much more love Piety, and true Sincerity. It is obſerved of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that of one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſed more love to <hi>Timothy,</hi> then any other: Read over all the book of God, you ſhall never find <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſe ſo much love to any, as to <hi>Timothy;</hi> he cals him <hi>Timothy my ſon,</hi> Timothy, <hi>who ſerveth me as a child,</hi> and <hi>Timothy my dearly beloved;</hi> and why was all this? Why the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Timothy</hi> from a child was converted, <hi>and knew the Scriptures.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. He was from a child converted and called by the Miniſtery of the word in <hi>Paul's</hi> mouth; and this did more indear the heart of <hi>Paul</hi> unto him. You read in the book of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> that when God did require a Sacrifice, he would not have an old Sheep, but a young Lamb, a Lamb of a year old, and a Kid of the yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115140:40"/>of the Flook: And it was ſignificative in this, not only to ſhew that Chriſt our Sacrifice ſhould die and ſuffer for our ſins in the flower of his age, but alſo to ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt looks upon that as an abominable Sacrifice, when you will not be of his Fold, while you are as young Lambs; O Beloved, Chriſt takes it wonderful kindly, if in your youth you do imbrace his call.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Yield not to the Devils temptation, conſidering this, that though you ſhould be converted in your old age, yet Chriſt cannot but take this very unkindly at your hands, that you ſhould put him off until your laſt end, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (if any part, yet) the worſt part for his ſervice. You know when Chriſt ſtood all the night for his Spouſe, <hi>till his head was full of dew, and his locks were wet with the drops of the night,</hi> he got him gone becauſe ſhe came not, and would ſtay no longer. O how unkindly (think you) will Chriſt take this, when he ſhall wait year after year, and yet you not imbrace his call!</p>
               <p>It is ſaid in <hi>Iſaiah, All the day long have I ſtretched out my hand to a rebellious people, yet they would not hear;</hi> and Mal. 1. <hi>Offer the Lame and the Blind to thy Governour, will he accept of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt muſt needs take this unkindly, that you ſhould give the Devil the flower of your age, and give to Chriſt but the decrepit and infirm parts of your lives; that the Devil ſhould ſuck out the Marrow of your youth, and onely give God the dry bones, a palſie head, a dim eye, a weak body, and ſo all your ſervices muſt needs be weak alſo: and think but how unkindly Chriſt will take your ſervices thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Conſider this, that from your Birth-day, to your dying day, you have time little enough to carry on the buſineſs of your ſalvation, ſhould you live never ſo long; and therefore you have no cauſe to put off the call of Jeſus Chriſt. And thus much be ſpoken by way of ſatisfaction, to take off the firſt temptation, that you are too young to give entertainment to the call of Jeſus Chriſt: and this I do
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115140:40"/>for the ſake of young men, that they may take heed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſnar'd by this deluſion of the Devil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Sug.</hi> 2. Here it may be, the Devil cannot inſnare you in this Gin: Old men will ſay, this concerns not me, I am not taken with this temptation; therefore now the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil comes upon them with this ſuggeſtion: Saith the Devil to them, You cannot now give entertainment to the call of Jeſus Chriſt, for you have callings in the world to follow; you have a particular calling, and you muſt provide for Wife, and Children, and Familie, and lay up for future times, againſt old age and ſickneſſe, and therefore you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at leaſure now to give entertainment to the call of Jeſus Chriſt; when I am more at leaſure, I may look after my effectual calling: And this alſo ſticks very cloſe to a great many.</p>
               <p>And to take off this ſuggeſtion of the Devil, I ſhall lay down ſix particulars alſo, by way of Anſwer. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, God never intended that our outward calling ſhould any way hinder us in the work of our converſion. God never intended that our imployments upon earth, ſhould juſtle out the neceſſary proviſion for heaven. But God hath ſo given out our callings here in the world, that he hath made and ordained them to be ſubordinate to our general and effectual calling, to the great buſineſs of Gods glory, and our own ſalvation.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> that <hi>he walked with God,
<note place="margin">Gen. 6 14</note> and was perfect in his generation.</hi> And yet <hi>Noah</hi> was imployed by God for ſome time, to wit, for 120 years in a Handycraft-calling, to build an Ark; to ſhew, that God did never intend, as if <hi>Noah</hi>'s making an Ark, ſhould any way hinder his walking with God, or carrying on the work of his ſoul. Though you have callings to follow, and Families to provide for; yet God did never intend your outward calling ſhould juſtle out your inward and effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider, you that make this Plea, whether you do not imbezel away much time from your outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which you do not imploy in the concernments of your
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115140:41"/>ſouls, but in the works of ſin and Satan. There is many a man that can plead he hath no leaſure to pray, nor no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to hear a Sermon, he muſt follow his calling; yet this man can follow a Whore, and follow a Tavern, and theſe men can ſpend a whole day upon recreation, and yet can ſpare no time, find no leaſure to hearken to Jeſus Chriſt. This now ſhould be a great conviction to you, that pretend you muſt follow your calling, that you can neglect your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to follow your ſenſual and vain courſes; and yet can ſpare no time to make your ſouls happy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You that plead your outward calling in the world, to be an excuſe why you cannot hearken to your effectual calling by Jeſus Chriſt; conſider this, that this plea hath damned many a ſoul before you, and will damn you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if you look not to it. This hath been an ancient plea, <hi>Luke.</hi> 14.18, 19, 20. When Chriſt called a company of men there to come to him, what excuſe have they? Saith one, <hi>I have bought a yoke of Oxen, and I muſt prove them. I have bought a Farm,</hi> ſaith another, <hi>and I muſt manage that. I have marryed a wife, and therefore cannot come,</hi> ſaith a third. All theſe were lawful callings, and yet theſe callings kept them from heaven, and kept them from Jeſus Chriſt. You read, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. When <hi>Paul</hi> did ſtartle <hi>Felix</hi>'s conſcience by a powerful Sermon of judgment to come, <hi>Felix's heart trembled;</hi> but mark now, how did <hi>Felix</hi> put off the power of the word? Why, <hi>Now</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am not at leaſure, but go thy wayes, and in convenient time I will ſend for thee</hi> to ſpeak of this matter. As if he ſhould ſay, I am now to go about ſome other buſineſs, about the affairs of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and cannot have leaſure to hear thee now; and ſo by ſome outward imployment, he juſtled the power of the word from his heart, and had not convenient time to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider this, That this plea of yours, (in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your callings an excuſe, to neglect your effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) it is the onely way to provoke God to curſe, and blaſt all your outward callings to you, and to ingage him to curſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115140:41"/>all you put your hands unto. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 1.6, 9. Becauſe they neglected Gods Worſhip, and Gods Ordinances, <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>you ſhall have much, but it ſhall come to nothing; and what you get, you ſhall put into a bag with holes:</hi> You ſhall loſe all you get, and all you ſow, and all you labour for, becauſe you would not look after Gods Worſhip. So <hi>Micah</hi> 6.13, 14. <hi>I will make thee ſick in ſmiting thee, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate becauſe of thy ſins. Thou ſhalt eat, and not be ſatisfied; thou ſhalt ſow, and not reap; thou ſhalt tread Olives, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint thy ſelf with oyl; and make ſweet wine, but ſhalt not drink it. For the ſtatutes of</hi> Omri <hi>are kept, and all the manners of the houſe of</hi> Ahab, <hi>and you walk in their counſels.</hi> As much as if the Lord ſhould ſay, You will not hearken to my Statutes, and to my Counſels, but <hi>Omri</hi>'s ſtatutes, and <hi>Ahab</hi>'s counſel you will hearken to, <hi>Therefore</hi> now, <hi>you ſhall eat, and not be ſatisfied; ſow, and not reap;</hi> that is, God will curſe what you have, and what you do, becauſe you will not hearken to Gods call and counſel. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.38, to 46. <hi>Thou ſhalt carry much ſeed into the field, and gather but little; the Locuſts ſhall conſume it;</hi> theres one curſe: <hi>And ſhalt plant Vineyards, but ſhalt not drink the wine, nor gather the grapes, the worm ſhall eat them;</hi> another curſe. <hi>Thou ſhalt have Olive-trees throughout all thy coaſts, but ſhalt not anoint thy ſelf with Oyl, for thy Olives ſhall fall;</hi> theres a third curſe. <hi>Thou ſhalt beget ſons and daughters, but ſhalt not enjoy them; all the trees, and fruit of the land ſhall be conſumed.</hi> Now what's the reaſon of all this? that God ſhould thus blaſt their callings, and their comforts to them? verſe 45. <hi>Yea, all theſe curſes ſhall come upon thee, and purſue thee, and overtake thee, becauſe thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenedſt no to the voyce of thy God, to keep his commandments, and his ſtatutes, which he commanded thee.</hi> Here is the reaſon, they would not hearken to God, nor obey God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would blaſt their comforts to them. Now then, Beloved, think of this, you that make your callings a plea, why you cannot hearken to the call of Chriſt; this plea is a great provocation to engage God to blaſt, and to curſe your very callings to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:115140:42"/>Fifthly, Take this conſideration, that God will the more bleſs you in your callings, and proſper you in the work of your hands, the more conſciencious you are in hearkning to the call and invitation of Jeſus Chriſt. And the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Godlineſs hath not onely a promiſe of the life to come, but of this life alſo.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. And <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>Bring ye all the tythes into the Store-houſe, that there may be meat in my houſe;</hi> that is, ſaith God, Uſe all means, and take all care, that there may be meat in my houſe, that Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be on foot, that my worſhip may be maintained; and what then? And if you will take care of his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, God bids you <hi>prove him, and try him, if he will not take care of you.</hi> ver. 11. Mark the words, <hi>Let there be meat in my houſe, and prove me now, ſaith the Lord; if I will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the windows of heaven, and poure forth a bleſſing upon you, and there ſhall not be room enough to receive it.</hi> A ſtrange bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; that if men will take care to have meat in Gods houſe, and have a care of Gods ordinances; God would open the very windows of heaven, and make the earth ſo fruitful, they ſhould not have room to receive Gods bleſſings. <hi>And I will rebuke the devourer for your ſakes, and all nations ſhall call you bleſſed, and call you a delightſome land.</hi> Here now you ſee if you will take care of Gods ordinances, and imbrace his call, God will bleſs your outward calling the more; and give you in a more abundant increaſe, if you imbrace the call of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You that urge your outward callings as a reaſon why you cannot hearken to the call of Chriſt; take this for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that if truth were known, it is not the urgencie of your callings, but the obſtinacie of your wils, and the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe of your ſpirits is the cauſe, you do not give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the cal of Jeſus Chriſt. If it were mens callings urged them, they would not take pleaſure in ſin; therefore, it is not their callings, but the badneſſe of their hearts; they do not love Chriſt, and love his waies, but think it too induſtrious a work to labour for converſion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make this plea. <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115140:42"/>me that ye might have life:</hi> When will is wanting, ſaith D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Preſton,</hi> any vain excuſe wil be pretended. When wil is wanting to walk in the waies of God, any groundleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence wil be made to excuſe their negligence. And thus much to take off the ſecond ſuggeſtion, that men have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to follow in the world, and therefore they have no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to look after their effectuall calling by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sug.</hi> Thirdly, The Divel ſuggeſts, if you give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the call of Jeſus Chriſt, this will expoſe you to a great deal of povertie, and perſecution in this world; and therefore you muſt not hearken to his call: And he will urge Scripture for this. Firſt, For povertie, the Divel wil urge <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.19.20. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>the Foxes have holes, the Birds of the air have neſts; but the Son of man hath no where to lay his head:</hi> The Divel wil urge this Scripture, and tell you, you are expoſed to povertie, want, and beggerie, if you follow Chriſt. And this we read in hiſtorie likewiſe of <hi>Lucius,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King that ever <hi>England</hi> had; (and indeed the firſt Chriſtian King that ever any Nation had, to the glory of <hi>England;</hi> ſo <hi>Gildas</hi> in his life tels us). And this King, though he was turned to Chriſtianitie; yet for many years he had this temptation upon him, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were poorer then the <hi>Romans,</hi> that did not imbrace Jeſus Chriſt; and this temptation he could hardly ſhake off: the <hi>Romans</hi> were more wealthie, and the <hi>Romans</hi> were more warlick, and ſo had like to have been overcome with this ſuggeſtion. <hi>Agolantus</hi> a heathen Prince, being taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner by the Emperour and being in his Court, he ſaw thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or forty poor men in poor clothes walking in the palace; and demanding of the Emper or who thoſe poor men were, the Emperour told him they are the followers of Jeſus Chriſt; are they ſo, ſaith he? If Chriſt keep his followers in ſuch a low condition, I will never follow Jeſus Chriſt. The poorneſſe of Chriſts followers, made him ſtumble at Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie. There are many men, eſpecially the gallants of the times, they ſee a companie of poor ſilly women come with a Bible under their armes; and they imbrace the faith, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115140:43"/>they love it; and this is a marvellous great offence to them, that they will not follow Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe of the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they are expoſed to in the waies of Jeſus Chriſt: And then for perſecution alſo, that they are not only expoſed to want, but to loſſe of libertie, and good name, and life alſo; <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.38. You muſt take up the croſs: theſe are tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous termes to fleſh and blood, and this doth wonderfully gravel and keep back men from entertaining of Chriſt. Now to take off this temptation of the Divel, that it might not ſeize upon your hearts, I ſhal lay down ſix particulars by way of anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the ſervants of God of old time, they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe povertie and perſecution with the people of God, then to enjoy the vanities and profits of this world with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. And this was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s choice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes when he came to years, refuſed to be called the ſon of</hi> Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs <hi>Daughter; chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſure of ſinne for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt better then all the riches of Aegypt. Moſes, when he came to yeers;</hi> it was no childiſh act, but an act of deliberation; and it was no conſtrained act, but <hi>Moſes choſe: rather,</hi> it was an act of his own choice, rather to have affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſure of ſin for a ſeaſon. It was ſpoken of Mr. <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot</hi> his being in the Cole-houſe at <hi>Windſor,</hi> a diſmal and dark place. Saith one, I had rather be with <hi>Philpot</hi> in the Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, then be with <hi>Bonner</hi> in his Palace. And being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, why? the one being ſo diſmal, the other ſo beautiful? ſaith he, the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Bonners</hi> conſcience makes his Palace a Cole-houſe; but <hi>Philpots</hi> God, and <hi>Philpots</hi> Chriſt makes his Cole-houſe a Palace. And Beloved, this is a truth, though a man ſhould be a beggar, if he be <hi>rich in faith,</hi> he is the happieſt man in the world. Though a man ſhould beg his bread from door to door, if he can beg Chriſt and have it, and beg grace and have it; he is the richeſt man upon earth. This therfore is my firſt anſwer, that the ſervants of God, had rather chuſe afflictions with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115140:43"/>of God, then have pleaſures with wicked men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe you meet with povertie and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in following Chriſt, yet conſider, Jeſus Chriſt doth make you abundant recompence with that inward peace, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy he fils your hearts withall, for all the outward troubles you meet with in the world. <hi>John</hi> 16.33. <hi>In the world you ſhall have tribulation;</hi> but mark the Cordial, <hi>In me ye ſhall have peace,</hi> therefore <hi>be of good chear, I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world.</hi> Though you have troubles in the world, yet you have joy in me, and peace in me; and therefore why ſhould you be offended?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, Though you want many things in the world, yet you ſhall want nothing that is good for you; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>He wil give grace and glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that live a godly life.</hi> If riches be good for thee, thou ſhalt not want it; if wealth be good for you, you ſhal not want it; if eſtate be good for you, you ſhall not want that; for he wil with-hold nothing from them that live a godly life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A gracious heart, if he hath or can find that he hath a real intereſt in Chriſt, though he wants much in the world,
<note place="margin">Habent om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, qui ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem omnia.</note> he thinks he wants nothing; but he hath all things in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Chriſt; nor will he complain of povertie, when endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the riches of heaven. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25. <hi>And Chriſt ſaid unto them, when I ſent you without purſe, and without ſcrip, and ſhoos, lacked you any thing?</hi> Mark the queſtion. Now, if a carnal man had been to anſwer this, what would he have ſaid? What? ſend a man without a purſe, then he wants mony; ſend him without a ſcrip, he wants meat; ſend him without ſhoos, a man is a poor man indeed, that hath no ſhoos to his feet; a carnal man would have ſaid, Yes Lord, we want mony, and we want meat, and we want ſhoos; but ask the Diſciples, <hi>wanted you any thing? They ſaid, Nothing.</hi> And why was this? Becauſe the Diſciples knew they had a grounded intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, and a right to Ieſus Chriſt, and though they wanted theſe poor outward comforts, they did not want Chriſts comfort, and Chriſts graces; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115140:44"/>when they had neither purſe, ſcrip, nor ſhoos, they wanted nothing. Why, O Beloved, if you were of the temper of theſe gracious Diſciples, you would ſay ſo too; that if you can find a grounded and real intereſt in Chriſt, though you want many of the Comforts of this world, you will ſay you want nothing. <hi>Wanted yee any thing? and they ſaid, Nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. You that make povertie and perſecution a plea, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, that the poor are ordinarily the moſt people that Jeſus Chriſt doth cal to imbrace his Goſpel. <hi>The poor receive the Goſpel,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and bleſſed are you that are not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at it; Not many wiſe, not many noble are called, but the poor things of the world hath God choſen.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26. And in <hi>James, God hath choſe the poor of this world, to be rich in faith.</hi> Do not therefore Beloved make this a plea to keep off from Chriſt, becauſe ordinarily they are the people Chriſt pitcheth moſt love upon, and doth delight to make them rich in grace, who are poor in goods.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider, That if upon this ground you refuſe the call of Ieſus Chriſt, you are expoſed to more Povertie, and to worſe perſecution then ever you could be expoſed to, in the entertaining of Chriſt. In the following of Chriſt, you are only expoſed to an outward povertie; but in neglecting the cal of Chriſt, you are expoſed to be poor in faith, and to be ſuch a beggar, as not to be endowed with one dram of grace; and then you are beggars indeed. As we ſay, he is a poor man that God hates; he that hath not Chriſt, and hath not the treaſures of heaven in him; he is expoſed to worſe povertie a thouſand times then he can be for embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cal of Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. Yea, and he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to worſe perſecution alſo, that for fear of perſecution, neglects Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.5. <hi>The Lord will perſecute them, ſaith</hi> David, <hi>with furie and wrath;</hi> ſpeaking of wicked men. All perſecution from man reaches but to the body, but this from God reacheth to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And then laſtly, This ſhould not hinder you from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Ieſus Chriſt; conſidering, that though you ſhould
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115140:44"/>be poor and ſhould be perſecuted, yet heaven wil make you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for al, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. Heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil make amends for poverty, when you are indowed with all the riches of Chriſt, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven wil make amends for perſecution; when there the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhal be at reſt, and there the troubled ſhal be at eaſe. And thus much be ſpoken of the third ſuggeſtion of the Devil, that if you entertain the cal of Jeſus Chriſt, you ſhal be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to much poverty, and perſecution here in the world.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Doctrine I am yet upon, is this. <hi>That Chriſtians ought to put forth a great deal of diligence, to make this ſure to their ſouls, that they are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In the proſecution of which, I have reſolved one caſe of conſcience, and am yet upon the ſecond caſe; namely, what ſuggeſtions the Devil doth uſe to keep men off from imbracing the call of Jeſus Chriſt: I have laid down and anſwered three already.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now there is one ſuggeſtion more; when the Devil ſees neither of theſe wil take place, then he comes in with a fourth, to diſſwade men from imbracing the call of Chriſt; and that is this, Why, ſaith the Devil, if you will entertain the call of Chriſt, you will abridge your ſelves of all the joy and comfort of your lives; you will never have merry daies while you live upon earth. You ſee men, that pretend to be converted, and do hear Sermons, what lumpiſh and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy men they are, not ſo jocund and jolly as others are, that walk not ſo preciſely; if you follow Chriſt, and his Goſpel, this wil caſheer all your merry daies, and this wil put you into a ſad temper; all your jovial daies are gone. Therefore to take off this aſperſion, that the wais of Chriſt are ſad and melancholy waies; which hath been an aſperſion that from age to age, &amp; generation to generation, hath been
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115140:45"/>as a Gin the Devil hath uſed to keep men from Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And I remember, it is one of the great Engines Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt uſeth to ſupport and uphold his Kingdome. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, to deter men from Chriſtianity, and the Proteſtant Religion, they would hold their Diſciples in hand with this, that the ſpirit of a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> is a ſad and lumpiſh ſpirit; and therefore they would diſſwade all Nations from turning to their Religion; and this the Prieſts were to tel in all the Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi> how ſad and melancholy they were, that turned to the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> Religion; and this did mightily ſtay the people from imbracing the truth. And this aſperſion hath paſſed from hand to hand, and is many times prevalent upon the ſpirits of men that are of the true Religion, that they muſt not be too forward in the practice of Religion, fearing leſt this ſhould work melancholy and ſad thoughts in them.</p>
               <p>Now to take off this, I ſhal onely urge four or five heads briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whereas you ſay, they are melancholy and ſad, that are called by Chriſt to a profeſſion of his waies; I would anſwer thus, That they of all people in the world, have moſt cauſe of mirth and gladnes, and they are the moſt truly joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people in the world. That they have moſt cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing is apparent: When the Diſciples came triumphing that they could caſt out Devils, heal the diſeaſed, and work Miracles: O, but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Rejoyce not in this, but rejoyce that your names are written in the book of Life, Luke</hi> 10.20. As much as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, All the indowments and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, they are no ſuch grounds of joy, if you had them all; but here is your joy, and cauſe of rejoycing, that your names are written in the book of Life; that you are in Chriſt, and your ſouls ſhal be ſaved. And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwaies, again I ſay, rejoyce.</hi> The Apoſtle would not ſpeak it to them with a ſingle command, but doubles his expreſſion, to ſhew, that they that are people that have their ſins pardoned, that have their ſouls reconciled, that have a Title to glory,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115140:46"/>whoſe names are written in the book of Life; theſe of all men in the world, have moſt cauſe of joy and gladneſs. And they have not onely moſt cauſe, but they do moſt truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and have more real joy in their hearts in one day, then the wicked can have all their lives, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>They rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> What joy you have in the world, the tongue is able to ſpeak of it, but the tongue is not able to ſpeak of that inward joy that godly men have in their hearts, upon the apprehenſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt they have in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance.</hi> And <hi>Thou ſhalt put more gladneſs in mine heart, &amp;c.</hi> Prov. 14.13. <hi>A good conſcience is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual feaſt.</hi> Men are never more merrie, then when they are at a feaſt; godly men, they carry clear conſciences about them, and that makes them as ioyous and pleaſant, as if they were alwaies at a great and ſumptuous feaſt. Indeed this is true, they do not rejoyce with ſuch exorbitancies of joy as wicked men do. Wicked men rejoyce in ſin, that they cannot do; wicked men rejoyce in their luſts, in their drunkenneſs, and their adulteries, and waies of ſin, that godly men dare not do. Such a rejoycing as this, is the foundation of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: This rejoycing (like the Prodigal) in a riotous courſe of living, is the foundation of ſorrow, and wil meet with you, when you are to die.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Grant this ſhould be true; yet conſider, that this ſorrow that godly people have, it is ſuch a ſorrow, that they ſhal have no cauſe to repent thereof, but it is a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of future joy to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>I rejoyce</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in that I have made you ſorrowful.</hi> What, rejoyce to ſee them a ſad people? Yes, for the ſorrow I made you ſorrowful with, was <hi>a ſorrow never to be repented of,</hi> you wil never repent of that ſorrow; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> would do it,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 126.</note> becauſe it was a ſorrow, never to be ſorrowed for; nay, it is not only ſuch a ſorrow as is not to be repented of, but it is a ſorrow that laies a foundation to a great deal of future joy, <hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy.</hi> But now all the joy of wicked men is a joy, to be repented of. They
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115140:46"/>muſt repent of all their jovial bouts, and repent of all their merrie paſtimes, this wil be ſadneſs to their remembrance; wheras the ſorrow of the godly is ne'er to be ſorrow'd for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is true, it may be they are ſorrowful, but they are ſorrowful for ſin, which you have cauſe to be that are uncalled, as wel as they, and more: Now if a godly man be ſorrowful for ſin, this wil never prejudice him. Indeed, <hi>Worldly ſorrow brings forth death,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but godly ſorrow brings forth ſalvation never to be repented of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It may be they are ſorrowful, but how is it? They are not ſorrowful becauſe they are good, but they are ſorrowful becauſe they are ſo bad. It is not profeſſion makes them ſorrowful, but it is becauſe they can profeſs Chriſt no better, and profeſs him no more zealouſly, this is their ſorrow; and this ſorrow ſhould be in all of us, that we can ſerve God no better, and bring God no more glory.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They are ſorrowful, but it is not for themſelves, but for thee; they are not ſorry becauſe they are good, but becauſe thou art ſo bad; they are ſorry becauſe of thy ſins, becauſe they ſee thee an uncalled man ſtil, and they ſee thee drunk, and ſee thee profane, and ſee thee diſhonour God, and damn thy ſoul; and this makes them more ſad then they would be. <hi>Lot, his righteous ſoul was vext within him, for the wickedneſſe of the Sodomites;</hi> 2 Pet. 2.8. And Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, <hi>his eyes run down with tears, for the iniquity of the people</hi> he lived amongſt. And ſo <hi>Paul, I told you before, and now tell you weeping;</hi> there are wicked livers among you, that walk not according to the truth. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Paul</hi> did not weep, becauſe he was miſerable; but becauſe he ſaw ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wicked, and abominable in their lives. So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>Mine eyes run down with water, becauſe men keep not thy Law.</hi> Ezek. 9.4.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, Though you ſee ſome men ſad and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet think not ill of the waies of God; becauſe, this way of all other, doth moſt invite to joy and gladneſs in the Lord. <hi>Rejoyce evermore, and again I ſay, rejoyce, Phil.</hi> 4.4. And <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>Theſe things I ſpeak,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that your joy might be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115140:47"/>full.</hi> In the profeſſion and following of Chriſt, it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of Chriſt to give you more joy, then ever you had before; there is no ſuch cauſe therefore to entertain a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice by the Divels temptation againſt the waies of Jeſus Chriſt, when he cals you to profeſſe his Goſpel. And thus much be ſpoken to the ſecond caſe of conſcience in reference to wicked men.</p>
               <p>There is a third caſe touching men uncalled, and that is, What deluſions doth the Divell deceive hypocrites by, to make them nouriſh preſumptuous perſwaſions that they are effectually called when they are not? And I intreat you, give me your attentions a little in the diſpatch of this mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial queſtion. I ſhall only lay down four Deluſions, whereby the Divel deceives many.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Deluſ. </seg>
                  </label> 1. The Divel may delude men by this, becauſe they do delight to hear the word preacht, therefore the Divel would egg on this perſwaſion, ſurely your delighting to hear the word, and your following of Sermons, this muſt needs be an evidence of your effectual calling. And here the Divel would miſapply Scripture, as <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that heareth not my words,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is not of God; he that is of God, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my words.</hi> Now, here th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Divel would miſapply this Scripture, and tel you, you that hear Gods word, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to hear Sermons, this can be no other then an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidence of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Now, I beſeech you to follow me in the taking off this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, and ſhewing you wherein, and in what caſes, this wil prove but a broken reed unto you. And I ſhall ſhew you that in five caſes, hearing the word of God with delight, is no evidence of effectual calling, but may be a meer deluſion of Satan. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. If your hearing the word, be but a bare hearing, and not a hearing with practice; if you have not practice joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with what you hear, and know, your thus hearing the word with delight, is no evidence of your effectual calling. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>They come before thee as my people cometh, thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voyce,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115140:47"/>as one that can play well upon an inſtrument of muſick.</hi> Here the Lord ſets forth with what delight they heard <hi>Ezekiel</hi> preach; they heard him as a man that had a very lovely voice, and they heard him as a man that plaied upon an Inſtrument of Muſick; much delight they took in hearing. Yet, ſaith God, <hi>they hear thy words, but do them not.</hi> Beloved, though you take as much delight in hearing a Sermon, as to hear the moſt melodious muſick a cunning hand can make; yet if you bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear with delight, not joyning practice with your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; this is no evidence of effectual calling. Hence it is <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. <hi>Be not hearers of the word only, but doers alſo, leſt you deceive your own ſouls.</hi> Implying, that you wil deceive your ſouls about effectual calling, if you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear, and do not do. This was the fault of the ſtonie ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If your hearing be a partial hearing: I mean thus; if you hear, and wil hear but part of the word, or leave but ſome part of your ſins by hearing, wil pick and chuſe both whom you wil hear, and what you wil hear; in that caſe, your hearing with delight can be no evidence of your effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling. If it be a partial hearing, as firſt, that you wil hear ſome part, and wil not hear the other; to hear the promiſing part, and not the commanding part; to hear with delight the commanding part, and not hear the threatning part of the word: in this caſe, thus hearing, wil be no evidence of your cal. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>Herod,</hi> it is ſaid of him, <hi>he heard John Baptiſt gladly, and did many things:</hi> There was his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial hearing: he heard him with joy in many things, but he would not do all. Now, if you aske, wherein was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> failing? <hi>Herod</hi> heard the word with gladneſs; yet this was no evidence of his effectual calling. Wherein did he fail, Why mark, compare this Scripture with <hi>Luke</hi> 3.18.19, 20 <hi>Herod,</hi> it is true, he heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly, while he preached of ordinarie matter; but when <hi>John</hi> came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him of his ſins, and told him he was an Adulterer, then he could not endure to hear <hi>John</hi> preach, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in his exhortation did John preach to the people, but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115140:48"/>Herod the Tetrarch being reproved by John, for Herodias his brother</hi> Philips <hi>wife, and for all the evils</hi> Herod <hi>had done, he added yet this above all, to ſhut up</hi> John <hi>in priſon.</hi> He would hear <hi>John</hi> no more then: Mark how the Scripture points out a wicked man; <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John</hi> gladly, when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of comfortable and general matter; but when <hi>John</hi> came to reproving matter, and convincing matter, then he would hear him no more; but added this ſinne to the reſt, to ſhut up <hi>John</hi> in priſon. So that to be a partial hearer, gladly to hear ſome part of the word, but not all, can be no evidence of effectual calling. So thoſe in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this temper, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.10. <hi>Propheſie to us ſmooth things, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie deceits.</hi> There were manymen could delight to hear ſmooth and comfortable preaching, but they could not endure to hear a true denunciation of Gods judgments againſt them for their ſinnes. They love to hear ſome part of Gods wil, not all; the promiſing part, not the reproving part; this is no evidence of effectual calling. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.17, 18. There were ſome lying Propheteſſes that did preach, but what did they do? <hi>They ſowed pillows under mens elbows;</hi> and the Lord charges them for it, <hi>that they did hunt after their ſouls.</hi> To preach ſmooth Doctrines, and plauſible comfortable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, is but to ſow pillows, and hunt after mens ſouls. Now, many men love to be ſmoothed up, and flattered in their ſins; whereas to be a partial hearer, is no ſign of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hearing the word with delight, is no evidence of your effectual calling, in caſe this be a fickle, and unconſtant hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. To delight to hear the word, becauſe the word comes in requeſt, becauſe there is no danger in hearing; this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men may delight to do, when yet if times of perſecution ſhould ariſe, they would be fickle, and leave off their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. It is ſaid of the ſtonie ground, that <hi>the ſeed that fell among stones, are they that receive the word with joy;</hi> (there is their delight to hear) <hi>but not having deep root, in times of perſecution fell away.</hi> Here the Scripture A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomizeth a man, that he may hear the word with joy ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115140:48"/>when the current of the times run for Religion, when the word comes in faſhion among a people, but if perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould attend the word, and a priſon attend hearing, you would then ſee how flag their delights would be in hearing the word: and in this caſe, you may delight to hear the word, yet be no evidence of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In caſe your hearing be a ſelfiſh hearing: As now, many men may hear the word with delight; why? Becauſe, they may get profit by hearing, and praiſe and vain glory by hearing the word; and this may make them wonderfully delight to hear. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.1. <hi>There was an innumerable companie went to hear Jeſus Chriſt, in ſo much the croud was ſo great, that one trod upon another to hear him;</hi> yet Chriſt ſaith of them, <hi>John</hi> 6.26. <hi>They come to hear me preach, but not for the word I teach, or the miracles I do; but for the loaves they eat of.</hi> It was not love to Chriſts perſon, or his miniſtrie, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw Chriſt with a few fiſhes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o feed ſo many men, they ſeeing of this miracle, this made them frequent the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie and word of Jeſus Chriſt. Many men may hear the word, when ſelfiſh advantage accompanies hearing, to get more trading, to be better thought of among their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; this is a ſelfiſh hearing, and in this caſe you may hear, yet not be effectually called. There is a phraſe in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7.14. <hi>They cried unto me, and they howled upon their beds, and they aſſembled themſelves for corn and wine.</hi> Here was a people, that aſſembled together at the ordinances of God; but what was their end? there was a dearth and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine likely to come; and here they would uſe duties to be a means to prevent a famine, and get corn and wine together. Here was a ſelfiſh end, and thus men may hear, yet have no evidence of their effectual call.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If your hearing be a divided hearing, and your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light a divided delight, this can be no Argument of your call. As thus, A man may delight to hear, yet if that man divide and ſhare his delights, partly to ſin, and partly to the Word, this can be no evidence of his effectual calling. In the place before quoted, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. <hi>They aſſembled together, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115140:49"/>howled upon their beds, yet they ſin againſt me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> There they divided their delights, they would ſerve God in his Worſhip, yet they would ſin againſt him. So thoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3, 6, 7. They took delight in drawing near to God, yet in the day of their faſt, found pleaſure in ſin. Now, to have a divided love, to delight in ſin, as wel as in Ordinances, this can be no Argument of effectual calling; and your hearing the Word in theſe five caſes, is but a meer deluſion. But on the contrary, if your hearing be not a bare hearing, but with your delight in hearing, you joyn practice; If it be not a partial hearing, but the commanding and reproving part as welcome as any other; If it be ſuch a hearing as is not ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, Such a hearing, in which you aim more at Gods glory then your own advantage; if theſe be the qualifications, then your delight in hearing the Word, is an evidence of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Deluſ. </seg>
                  </label> Yea, but you will urge farther, Though this be not an Argument of our effectual calling, yet we can go one ſtep higher; We do not onely delight to hear the Word, but we love the godly who are effectually called to grace and glory; and if we love them, we hope it is an Argument that we alſo are called: and they urge that Scripture for it, <hi>We know that we are tranſlated from death to life, if we love the Brethren.,</hi> 1 Ioh. 3.14.</p>
               <p>Now, to ſpeak to this: I anſwer, It is clear in Scripture, that every kind of love to the people of God, is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of effectual calling; but there may be a fained, and a counterfeit love, as wel as any other grace. Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle preſſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Let your love be without diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> importing, that men may diſſemble their love, as wel as any grace elſe. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Let us not love in word and in tongue onely, but in deed and in truth.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Let there be unfained love to the Brethren:</hi> intimating, that there may be a fained and falſe love. So that every kind of love, is no evidence of effectual calling. And this I ſhal make out by this demonſtration; Becauſe there are ſeveral acts or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of love, that men who are not effectually called,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115140:49"/>may ſhew to godly men. Now if a man uncalled, may ſhew many expreſſions and acts of love to a man converted; then meer ſhewing love to a godly man, is no Argument of your effectual calling. I ſhal reduce what I have to ſay, unto ſix Heads: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may be frequently in the companie of godlie men, yet not be effectually called; and ſo <hi>Demas</hi> was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Goſpel; yet he not called, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the world, and fel away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They may ſpeak wel of the people of God. And this <hi>John</hi> tels us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Let us not love in word, or in tongue.</hi> This loving in word and tongue, was to ſpeak wel of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie man; this a wicked man may do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may write Letters of commendation in the behalf of a godlie man. And ſo you read of <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Wife, which the Scripture gives as no evidence of her Converſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.19. She wrote a Letter to her Husband in the morning before he was to arraign Chriſt, and told him, <hi>Have nothing to do with the blood of that juſt man.</hi> Here you ſee, ſhe wrote in the behalf of a good man, of Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo we read of <hi>Claudius Lyſias,</hi> that he wrote a Letter in the behalf of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Felix</hi> the Governor; here were great acts of love, yet theſe no evidence of their effectual calling. Nay,</p>
               <p n="4">4. They may think nothing too much to give to good men, yet not be called. And ſo did the <hi>Galathians,</hi> whoſe calling <hi>Paul</hi> queſtions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. <hi>They would pull out their own eyes, and not think them too dear for Paul:</hi> Yet at length how cold did they grow, <hi>and count</hi> Paul <hi>their enemy, for tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them the truth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They may expreſs ſuch love, that in times of danger they may take care of the ſafetie of godlie men, ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 23.27. <hi>Claudius Lyſias,</hi> when he heard <hi>Paul</hi> was in danger of his life, he came with an Armie of men to reſcue him, that they ſhould not take away his life from him; and yet <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Lyſias</hi> lived and died a Heathen, for ought the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture mentions.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, They may relieve the neceſſities of the godlie, yet
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115140:50"/>not be effectually called. Now here are high expreſſions of love, yet it is evident, all theſe may be, where calling is not.</p>
               <p>But now its true, in ſome caſes love to the people of God, may prove a good evidence of ones effectual call; to wit, if it have theſe four qualifications.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you love the people of God under this notion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe godlie, it is an evidence of your effectual call; becauſe there is good in them, more then becauſe you receive good from them. Hence it is, <hi>John</hi> tels us, wicked men may love a godlie man, becauſe they have good from him. 2 <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>To the elect Lady, whom I love in the truth, for the truths ſake dwelling in her. John</hi> did not love the Ladie, becauſe ſhe was a Ladie, or becauſe ſhe was a goodlie wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but <hi>for the truths ſake that dwelt in her.</hi> Whereas wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, they love a godlie man, but not as godlie, under that notion. Therefore you ſhal ſee the difference between <hi>Johns</hi> love to a godlie perſon, and <hi>Claudius Lyſias</hi> a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.27. <hi>Claudius Lyſias</hi> tels you there, <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>was in danger of his life, and with an Army I reſcued him.</hi> Now why was it he did ſo? did he love <hi>Paul</hi> becauſe a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie man? no, for mark the next words; <hi>With an Army I reſcued him, becauſe it was told me he was a Roman.</hi> He loved <hi>Paul</hi> for his Nation, not for his converſion: had he loved <hi>Paul</hi> as <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> as a Chriſtian, this were an Argument of grace; but to love <hi>Paul</hi> as a Roman, becauſe of Country and Nation ſake, this was no evidence of his call. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.46, 47. <hi>If ye love them that love you, what reward have you? do not even the Publicans ſo?</hi> So that you ſee a wide difference between the love of a godlie man, and of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To meaſure your love to them by their graces, that you love that man moſt, that hath moſt grace, thats an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of effectual calling; becauſe it is grace in the man, and nothing elſe you love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If your love be univerſal to all that are godly, of what ſort or condition ſoever they be, this is an evidence of your
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115140:50"/>effectual calling; for then 't is evident, that grace, as grace, is the object of your love.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, To love a man ſo, as to carry compaſſion in your breſts towards him, to have a ſympathizing heart with him in his ſufferings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Sufferone with another, love as Brethren.</hi> This ſhewes your love to be true, when it hath pity and compaſſion to attend it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Deluſ. </seg>
                  </label> I paſs now to a third deluſion, which indeed is a main delufion, and hath deceived many, ſpecially thoſe that profeſs the Goſpel, to make them believe they are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called, when they are not. And that is, becauſe they diſcern a change in their converſation, that they are not the ſame men they were in days paſt; and hereby the Divel props up this perſwaſion, that ſurely they muſt needs be effectually called, and he alledges Scripture for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but yee are waſhed,</hi> &amp;c. Now this being ſo univerſall a deluſion among moſt men in the world, that if they have hopes of Heaven, it is upon this ground, that they are not the ſame now they were in times paſt. I ſhall therefore a little inlarge my ſelfe in ſpeaking of this particular and ſhall lay downe ſix or ſeven particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, wherein I ſhall ſhew, that this ground taken in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is no infallible evidence of a mans effectuall calling.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe there are many graduall changes, which do not come up, or amount to a ſaving change or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart of man. As there is a change from a Pagan to a Chriſtian, ſo was <hi>Julian</hi> chang'd, yet a man never called by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Then there is a change from a perſecuter to be a countenancer of Religion, ſo we read <hi>Valerius Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iminus</hi> was changed, who was the vileſt perſecuter of all men in his time, and the hand of God lying ſo ſore upon him for that ſin, that his very bowels rotted within him, and the very worms crept out of them, and in horror of conſcience he cryed out to his Nobles about him, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them by his example, to take heed never to perſecute the Chriſtians more. Now both theſe were great changes, and yet they are but graduall changes, that leave men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115140:51"/>ſhort of thoſe ſaving changes that God works in them that are effectually called. Thirdly, There is a change from prophaneneſſe to profeſſion, and yet this is a ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a ſaving change. Fourthly there is a ſtep from profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into ſincerity, into a reall poſſeſſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now thoſe three ſteps they fall ſhort of a ſaving change, and therefore every change of life doth not argue a man to be effectually called, becauſe there are many graduall chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that do not amount to ſo high a pitch as this, to be ſavingly changed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There may be a change in the life, when there is no change in the nature, or in the heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. they may <hi>waſh the out ſide of the Cup, when within it is full of pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The life may be changed, the externall acts and courſe may be changed, when the heart may not be changed, and the nature the ſame ſtill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There may be a great change in a mans life, proceeding, not from a change in their nature but from the times wherein they live: the times are changed, therefore they are changed; the times do not favour ſuperſtition, therefore they will not ſhew their ſuperſtitious hearts, the times countenance not profaneneſs, therefore they will not be profane. Beloved, a change in a mans life may flow many times from a change of the times wherein they live, and yet this change, no Argument of a heart change, or of effectual calling by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A change in your life, may proceed from a change in your ſin not from a change in your heart: as thus, A man may be a Drunkard, may be an Adulterer, may be a profane liver in times paſt, and may change theſe ſins for other ſins. He may change his Drunkenneſs into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and be a covetous Worldling. He may change his Adultery for Idolatry, and be a ſuperſtitious man. He may change Profaneneſs into Hypocriſie, and be an Hypocritical man. He may change his looſe practice into a looſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be an erroneous man. Now this is no change of the heart, but onely a change of the ſin; you have not the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115140:51"/>ſame ſins you had, but you have other ſins in place of them; and men may thus have a change in their life, flowing from a change in their ſin, yet no argument of effectual calling. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.36. <hi>Why gaddeſt thou ſo much to change thy way?</hi> The people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they would be alwaies chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, now they would be for God, anon for <hi>Baal;</hi> now for Gods true Worſhip, anon for falſe Worſhip; they would be ever changing their ſin, but never leaving it; onely change their old ſins for other ſort of ſins. And ſo there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men now adaies changed, they are turned from Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and are come to be Profeſſors; it may be they have not ſo groſs ſins now, as in times paſt; in times paſt they would oppoſe Religion, and now they profeſs it; though they have left their oppoſition, they have ſome ſin more eminent then that. Many men have been looſe in practice, they have changed that, to be looſe in judgment; this is no change of heart all this while: ſo that, take this for a truth, there may be a change in the life, when the heart remains unchanged ſtill.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There may be a change in mens lives, ariſing from a change in the occaſions to ſin, and not from a change in the heart: As now, A Lion that will go ramping and roaring up and down, devouring his prey when he is at large; yet put this Lion in a Den, there he is quiet, and will offer no hurt: now the Lion is a Lion ſtill, and hath his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous diſpoſition ſtill, only he hath not ſo fair an occaſion to ſhew his rage. It is thus with men, many men want occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and opportunities to ſhew their wickedneſs, and the evil of their natures, and therefore do not diſcover them: What's the reaſon many a man was a drunkard before, and is not ſo now? It may be drunkenneſs hath brought begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and now he hath not money to ſit upon an Ale-bench. What's the reaſon a man was an adulterer before, and is not ſo now? It may be he hath ſpent his ſtock, and ſpent his ſtrength upon Whores, and now he hath neither ſtrength nor purſe to ſo low after them. It is no thanks to you, if God take away your occaſions of ſinning: men may be thus
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115140:52"/>changed, yet have no change in the heart at all.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Many men may change their lives, becauſe they come into better companie, haply their companie is better then in times paſt; and this may work in them a change in their lives.
<note place="margin">2 Kin. 12.2.</note> As we read of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> all the while he was in <hi>Jehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s companie, he was a wel ordered man in his life; but when he was dead, and he came to have wicked men about him, then he ſhewed the wickedneſſe of his heart.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, Everie change is not an evidence of effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, becauſe there may be a change in the life, proceeding from a wrong principle, and tending to a wrong end: As thus, a man may change his life from a wrong principle; what's that? I will name two wrong principles of a change in unconverted men. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Men may change their lives, becauſe of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent outward affliction, that lies upon them in this life; their afflictions may inforce them to change their waies, and not be ſo bad as in former daies, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.5. when they were in a ſtorm in the ſhip, <hi>every man went and prayed to his God.</hi> What a change was here? yet the change was onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the danger, they were in danger of death, and therefore they grew religious: Every man when a danger and affliction lies upon him, that will make him betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God and be a better minded man. And ſo <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when God ſent ten ſore plagues upon him, the plagues did inforce <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to confeſs his ſin, and beg of <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for him; and yet this change in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was onely becauſe of the preſent affliction that lay upon him, which wrought this change, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.23. <hi>Oh Inhabitants of Lebanon, how gracious wilt thou be, when thy pangs ſhall come upon thee?</hi> When pangs and afflictions were upon them, then they would be a gracious people. There is many a man will change his life, when God brings pangs, and death, and ſickneſs upon him; theſe are forc'd waies that God takes, to make a wicked and ſtout-hearted wretch change his life, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.12. Its ſaid there, <hi>When Moab is weary, Moab will come to my Sanctuary and pray.</hi> What a change was here in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab?
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115140:52"/>Moab,</hi> an Idolatrous company, that hated Gods people, and were enemies to all goodneſs; yet when they were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Gods hand lay heavie upon them, then they would pray, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.12. So that you ſee clearly, though men do change their lives, yet if this change flow onely from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affliction they lie under, that Gods hand upon them doth even force them to change their courſe, this is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a ſaving change, and ſo by conſequence no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Men may change their courſe from this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple alſo, Becauſe of that horror of conſcience that ſeizeth upon them, in the apprehenſion of hell, and the wrath of God; and from this Principle, a Heathen may change his courſe. It is noted by one upon that place in <hi>Peter, It happens unto them, as the Dog that turns to his vomit, &amp;c.</hi> Upon thoſe words he hath this note; That the Dog in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, carries reſemblance to a wicked man leaving his ſin. Now ſaith this Author, The Dog when he vomits, it is by reaſon of ſome qualm and pang that is in his ſtomack, and when he hath that pang, he will diſgorge himſelf, and eaſe himſelf by vomit; not as if he loathed his meat, but if he could free himſelf from thoſe pangs, he would fain have the meat in his body to nouriſh him. Thus a wicked man, he may diſgorge and vomit up his ſins, and leave his ſins, but why? it is not becauſe he hates his ſins, no, he would keep them <hi>as a ſweet morſel under his tongue;</hi> but it is becauſe thoſe ſins cauſe horror and trouble of conſcience, he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor he cannot follow his luſts, but conſcience will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. Now if thou change thy ſin, onely to ſtop con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences mouth, and muzzle conſcience, this is no argument of effectual calling.</p>

                  </label> Fourthly, men are tempted by the Divel to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh preſumptuous perſwaſions, that they are effectually called when they are not; becauſe they are miſcalled and reproached by the men of this world. Now think they, I ſhould never be miſcalled, and reproached by wicked men, if I were not called by my God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:115140:53"/>Now to take off this briefly, I anſwer: Every reproach from wicked men, can be no argument of an effectual call from God; becauſe men may be miſcalled upon a twofold ground: There are ſome men <hi>ſuffer as Chriſtians, and ſome as evil-doers;</hi> we may ſuffer either for Chriſts ſake, or for our own ſakes: The diſtinction is laid down 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15, 16, 17. <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as a Murtherer, as an evil doer, as a Theef, as a Buſie body in other mens matters; but if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian let him not be aſhamed.</hi> So that ſome men may be puniſhed for their own evils they have done, and ſo ſuffer no more then they have deſerved; but other men ſuffer for their profeſſion, becauſe they profeſs Jeſus Chriſt. Now to ſuffer becauſe of your evil doings, this can be no evidence; but to ſuffer for Chriſt, meerly for profeſſing his Name; this is an argument of effectual calling. Therefore Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth thoſe bleſſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Bleſſed are you when men ſhall revile you, and ſpeak evil of you for my ſake:</hi> This is an evidence of your effectual calling by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Doctrine I am yet upon, drawn from theſe words, is this; <hi>That Chriſtians ſhould put forth a great deal of diligence to make this ſure to their ſoules, that they are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In the proſecution of which, I have gone over many particulars, and reſolved ſome caſes of conſcience in reference to wicked men. I am now at this time to diſpatch ſome caſes of conſcience more, touching them that are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt; As</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether men that are effectually called by Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtate of grace, and hope of glory, may in this life at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to an infallible and firm aſſurance of their own effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be found that it is attainable in this life, then what is the reaſon that many Chriſtians who are effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, do ſo much ſuſpect and doubt their own calling, and walk ſo ſadly for want of their aſſurance?</p>
               <p n="3">3. What muſt be done that ſo you may make it ſure to your own ſoules, that you are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Firſt, whether it be attainable in this life, that men who are effectually called by Chriſt, may have a firm and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115140:54"/>aſſurance of their own call? And in reſolution of this I ſhall briefly free it from two extreames, both of which are untrue about this Query.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that of the Papiſts, who utterly deny any ſuch thing as aſſurance about a mans Calling, Juſtification, or Election by God, and they hold all their followers in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, affirming that the moſt a man can have, is a conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctural faith; an hope or conjecture that he ſhall be ſaved. And hence it is, that in that Popiſh Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> they made this Canon;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Si quis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerit homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem rena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum teneri ex fide ad credendum ſe certò eſſe ex numero Praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorum, anathema ſit. Seſſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Can</hi> 15.</note> That if any man doth ſay, that he is bound of faith to believe that he is certainly in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gods called ones, or juſtified ones, or elect ones, let him be <hi>Anathema,</hi> let him be accurſed. That man that would ſo much as take this aſſurance to himſelf, they would hold that man accurſed. And the reaſon why they do it, is, becauſe they hold another error, to wit, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from grace; which they could not maintain, did they not hold this alſo; this is the firſt extream.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another extream is of the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> they being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in this point of aſſurance, to confute them who deny all aſſurance, they run into this extream, to hold that aſſurance is of the nature of faith, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath faith, hath aſſurance: but this is another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, and an uncomfortable doctrine for doubting Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, were it true. Therefore to keep this truth in the middle betwixt two extreames, I ſhall lay down this poſition by way of Anſwer: That though ſometimes perſons effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, may be without a particular aſſurance of their own call, yet this aſſurance is attainable by Chriſtians in this life; and Chriſtians may be aſſured of their own effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling. And this I ſhall prove by four Mediums.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Apoſtle injoynes it here in my Text, <hi>Give diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure.</hi> Now this is a rule in Divinity, No man is bound to do a thing impoſſible, and therefore in that we are commanded and bound to do it, it is clear that it is poſſible, and may be made ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:115140:54"/>Secondly, Becauſe it is the office of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, to work this particular aſſurance in the hearts of thoſe that are effectually called, that they are in the ſtate of grace, and ſhall be brought to glory. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>We have received not the ſpirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> 1 John 5.10. <hi>He that believeth, he hath a witneſſe in himſelfe;</hi> a witneſſe to his own ſoul, that he doth believe. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13, 14. There the Spirit is called <hi>a Seal; you are ſealed by the Spirit of Promiſe;</hi> and verſe 14. It is called <hi>the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of our inheritance.</hi> Now a ſeal, and earneſt, is to give more aſſurance to a Promiſe; and here the Spirit of God is given to Believers as a Seal, and earneſt-Penny, that as they have the firſt fruits in grace, they ſhall have their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt in glory. 1 John 4.13. <hi>Hereby we know we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us his Spirit.</hi> It is the office of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt to aſſure our hearts in this particular. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witnes with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Particular ſervants of God in Scripture, that have been partakers of this mercy, they have had this firm aſſurance of their effectual calling; I ſhall inſtance in three. Firſt in <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Scripture tells us of him, that he had a clear evidence of his effectual calling, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> There he had a particular aſſurance that Chriſt loved him, and gave himſelf for him. So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am perſwaded alſo, that what I have committed to him, he will keep till the laſt day.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth there is a Crown laid up for me.</hi> Nay not onely <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Job</hi> alſo, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and I ſhall ſtand up before him at the last day:</hi> he knew Jeſus Chriſt was his Redeemer. And ſo <hi>David</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>Thou art my God, and I will praiſe thee. Pſal.</hi> 118.28. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Surely the goodneſſe and merey of God ſhall follow me all the dayes of my life.</hi> So that put
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115140:55"/>theſe together: God commands it, it is the ſpirits office to work aſſurance in the heart, and particular ſervants of God have had this aſſurance, therefore why may it not be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? But if you ſay, theſe were not ordinary ſervants of God, theſe were ſervants of a higher rank and form; but may ordinary weak Chriſtians know this alſo? Yes. Therefore,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Not only particular Saints have had this, but the people of God in General; they have declared in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that they have injoyed this particular aſſurance of their effectual Calling and ſafety of their condition by Chriſt. Inſtance in a few. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Doubtleſſe thou art our Father.</hi> They made no doubt of it, they were ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded they feared it not. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24. <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I righteouſneſſe and ſtrength. Surely:</hi> a word of confidence, they were aſſured they had righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for their juſtification in Chriſt Jeſus. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>We know, that if our earthly Tabernacle be diſſolved, we have a building of God eternal in the heavens.</hi> They knew that when they died, they ſhould ſee God in heaven; not only <hi>Paul,</hi> but other godly Chriſtians with him. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>You know in your ſelves, that God hath provided for you a better and more induring ſubſtance.</hi> They were aſſured within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that when they ſhould die, or loſe their eſtates here, God had provided for them a more enduring ſubſtance. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>Hereby we know, that we are of the truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before God.</hi> So verſe 14. <hi>We know we are tranſlated from death to life, &amp;c.</hi> So that what can be more clearly proved then this, that this aſſurance is to be attained in this life: becauſe God commands it, it is the ſpirits office to work it, particular Chriſtians have had it, and the people of God in general they have enjoyed and profeſt this Temper.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> Is it ſo then that aſſurance is attainable in this life? Then how much to blame are our adverſaries the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who hold their followers in ſuſpenſe, that they muſt live without the aſſurance of their own eſtate, that their ſoules muſt hang in feares and doubts all their dayes, that the moſt they can have is only a conjecture; oh into what a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115140:55"/>gulph of diſcomforts do they plunge them. Beloved, the Lord in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy, chap.</hi> 29. did pronounce it as a curſe, that their lives ſhould hang in ſuſpenſe; it's a greater curſe that mens ſouls ſhould hang in ſuſpenſe, that men ſhall not know whether they ſhall be ſaved or damned, it's a hell on this ſide hell; and therefore they are much to be blamed, that hold their followers in hand with a peradventure they ſhall be ſaved, peradventure not; when the Scripture is ſo clear in this thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly,  Let not the thoughts either of the impoſſibility or the difficulty of attaining this aſſurance, diſcourage you from looking after it. It is not impoſſible, though it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult indeed; and the difficulty ſhould be ſo farre from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging you, that it ſhould quicken your endeavours, to make your calling and election ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Seeing aſſurance is attainable in this life,  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the cauſe why you who are effectually called, have not attained this aſſurance before now. And this puts me upon handling of the ſecond caſe of conſcience; ſeeing this aſſurance is attainable. Therefore</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> Secondly, what is the reaſon that many Chriſtians who are called effectually by Jeſus Chriſt, do live in many doubts and feares about their effectual calling?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doubt. </seg>
                  </label> In anſwer to this I ſhall lay down theſe three particulars, that the doubts that do ariſe in Chriſtians about their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they flow from this threefold fountain.</p>
               <p>Either firſt, from ſome ſeeming defect, they apprehend in the manner of their calling. Or</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſome ſeeming defect they apprehend to be in the meanes of their calling. Or elſe</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſome ſeeming defects they apprehend in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their calling; and theſe three grounds are the riſe from whence many Chriſtians effectually called, do doubt of their call, and are not aſſured of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It doth ariſe from ſome ſeeming defect, they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be in the manner of their calling; They ſay I am not called in ſuch a manner as I ſee others are. As thus. Think
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115140:56"/>they, I ſee other men when they are converted, that their humiliations are great, I ſee that they have horror of conſcience, that they are wrought upon by the terrors of the law, that they are exceedingly humbled before God; Now for my part, I never found this manner of Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my ſoul, I never found that I could ſee my ſins clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or could be humbled for them greatly; I never found thoſe humiliations and legal Terrours which I hear many men talk of, and this makes me doubt, whether I am effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called or no. Now to take off this, I ſhall onely ſpeak three things by way of Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is true, God doth proceed after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with ſome, yet God is not tied and confined to one and the ſame way of working with all. What if he come to you in a calm, when he comes to others in a Tempeſt, if God come to you in a more peaceable and quiet way? What if God do not pierce your heart, as he did thoſe 3000. in the <hi>Acts,</hi> if he kindely open thy heart like <hi>Lidia</hi>'s without noiſe? God is not to be tied to one and the ſame way in converting all. As 'tis ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>The winde bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> ſo how it liſteth alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You have no cauſe to doubt for this, becauſe it's Gods uſual manner to proceed after this way, only with ſuch men who have been looſe in their lives, who have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in their wills, who have been very ſcandalous in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation before their converſion and call. But it is not Gods uſual way to work thus upon Chriſtians, who have been religiouſly brought up from their youth; it is not Gods way to dowſe them into ſuch a pit of horror, and plunge them into ſuch a depth of fears, that have been of a fair and ingenuous and moral life before their call. As you know it is with Carpenters, they give more blowes to knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Timber, then they will do to ſmooth and tender wood; thus doth God, when he meets with a knotty ſinner, a wretched ſtout-hearted ſinner, God muſt give him many blowes by humiliation, before he will be humbled, before he can bring him to be a ſerviceable piece in Gods build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115140:56"/>whereas Chriſtians of a milde and ſofter temper, they ſhall have fewer blowes, and ſhall not have the terrors of God ſtick ſo faſt in their hearts, as others ſhall. Hence you read that phraſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.5. Saith the Lord, <hi>I will hew them by my Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> God doth hew ſome men, hew them with judgments, and hew them with terror: Yea, but others that are not ſo looſe as they; <hi>I taught Ephraim to go, I led Ephraim by the Armes, and I drew him with cords of a man, and with the bands of love, Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. God you ſee, would hack and hew ſome men with terror and wrath, but others he would draw with love, and the cords of a man. Now ſuppoſe God hath not hacked and hewed thee with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if God melt thee with loving kindneſſe, and if God gain upon thy ſoul with mercy, and with love and grace, thou muſt not blame God, thou muſt not confine God; for this is Gods way of working ſometimes, as well as by wrath. God works upon ſome with wrath, he will allure others with loving kindneſſe; ſo that you have no cauſe or ground of fear, that you are not effectually called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you apprehend ſome defects in the manner of your call; becauſe it is Gods uſual way to plunge them in moſt humiliation, and moſt terrour, that have been moſt wicked liv'd men before their call, and not ſo ordinarily with men religiouſly trained up from their youth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God, when he goes to call a ſinner to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he looks upon the temper of thoſe that are to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and God ſees ſome men of a rugged Temper, that their Tempers will not be won, but by wrath, and by fire, and by hell, and by Judgement. And ſo it's like <hi>Felix</hi> was, his Temper was ſuch that nothing could convert him, but wrath and Judgement to come, Terrible Doctrines. Some are of this Temper, that nothing but wrath and hel-fire can work upon them. As children, there are ſome that are of ſuch ſoft, and tender Tempers, that the ſhaking of a rod may do them good; there are other children, if a man ſhould whip them every day, they would never leave their childiſh tricks: It is ſo with ſinners, God ſees ſome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115140:57"/>of a more tender and ſoft Temper that love will gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; others are of a rugged diſpoſition, that nothing but wrath can affright them; Now God in the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of his grace, he obſerves their Temper, and if he ſeeth love will gaine more upon them, then wrath will do, he will take that courſe; but if God ſee nothing but wrath, and fire, and horrour will do it, then he will work that way. This you read in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 22, 23. <hi>On ſome,</hi> ſaith the holy Ghoſt, <hi>have compaſſion, making a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; but others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire.</hi> The meaning is this, There are ſome that you muſt ſhew ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe and compaſſion to, in calling and working upon them, they are of a tender Temper; but others there are that you muſt ſave with feare, that is, preach terrible Sermons to them, and fright them with hel-fire and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come. For God doth obſerve the different Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in men, and hereupon doth proceed in different wayes of Adminiſtration in working upon them. Now it may be, thou that doſt thus complaine, thou never hadſt theſe Terrors in thy ſoul, and yet art effectually called, it may be God ſaw thy Temper more to be won by kindneſſe, and more gained upon in a way of love, therefore wrought upon thee this way; God is not bound to one way: And therefore we may juſtly count them blame-worthy who preach onely free grace, and Gods love, and ſo tie God to one Method; and they are to blame on the other ſide likewiſe (if there be any ſuch) that preach one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Terror and wrath; for God obſerves the Temper of mens diſpoſitions, ſome to be knotty, and ſome ſoft, and accordingly proceeds in his way of working with them. This ground therefore for your doubts is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſecond ground that makes men doubt of their effectual calling, is upon the apprehenſion of ſome ſeeming defect, that may be in the means of their calling. As thus; Think they, I have read in the Word, that it doth pleaſe God to uſe preaching as the ordinary means
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115140:57"/>to call and convert ſinners to Chriſt. <hi>It pleaſed God by preaching to ſave them that believe,</hi> I read this alſo that <hi>faith comes by hearing,</hi> (Now many a poore ſoul hath this that gravels his conſcience, and troubles his ſpirit.) but alas, I finde a defect in this means. For my part I cannot ſay I was converted by hearing a Sermon, that which did work upon me was ſome other means. One of theſe three, either I was converted (ſaith one) by living in a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly family, among good Chriſtians, ſeeing their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that firſt gained upon me; Or, ſaith another, I was gained upon by reading a Chapter in the Bible, or in ſome good book, and that firſt wrought upon me; Or, ſaith a third, It may be, if it was the Word, it was the Word preached by a wicked man, that is now turned either erroneous in judgement, or prophane in practice: and this occaſioneth a great deal of Jealouſie. The Word preacht by the mouth of a godly Miniſter is Gods ordinary way, but I was altogether out of this way, and therefore this doth make him ſuſpect the truth of his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling. Now, Beloved, I beſeech you, lend me your thoughts a little for I would fain make this Doctrine as comfortable to every called one as I can. I ſhall ſpeak of all theſe in order, and ſhew you, that put caſe either of theſe have been the means of thy calling, yet thou haſt no reaſon to doubt of thine effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Firſt, thou ſuſpecteſt thy call, becauſe the meanes hath been, ſayeſt thou, not by hearing a Sermon, or the Word preacht, but by living among good Chriſtians, and ſeeing their example and their living, thou cameſt by this meanes to love the wayes of God; and this was the firſt meanes that converted thee. Beloved, I doubt not, but I ſpeak to a great many, that cannot ſay a Sermon ever converted them, but onely, that they were gained to Gods wayes, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth, this way: now what ſhall I ſay to ſuch men as theſe? why, I would ſay thus much; that though the Lord did not uſe his Word preached, the ordinary meanes of converting ſoules, in calling thee, yet God is not tied
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115140:58"/>and bound up to his Word preacht, but he may uſe other meanes to convert thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and more particularly, that living among good people, and ſeeing of their example both in life and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we finde in Scripture to be a very efficacious means of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to convince, ſometimes to convert; and if you can finde out this in Scripture, you may have abundance of comfort. It hath been a meanes oftentimes to convince, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. <hi>They ſhall be aſhamed to ſpeak evill of you, while they behold your converſation in Chriſt.</hi> When they ſhall ſee that you live in Chriſt, and walk according to Chriſt, they ſhall be aſhamed; aſhamed of what they have done, and what they have ſpoken; it ſhall convince them. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. And the Apoſtle when he ſpeaks of the orderly and regular managing the worſhip of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. <hi>If there comes an unbeliever among you, &amp; he ſees your order,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he ſhall fall down in the midſt of you, he ſhall be convinced, and ſhall ſay, Of a truth God is among you.</hi> Seeing this, (ſaith the Apoſtle) godly men holy in their lives, and holy in their worſhip, though he be an unbeliever, he ſhall fall down and ſay, Of a truth God is among you: that is, by way of conviction. Nay further, ſometimes God doth bleſſe the gracious lives, and blameleſſe example of Chriſtians to be a means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert ſome, when the Goſpel cannot do it; and you would think this very comfortable, could it be made good. I would commend but one Text of Scripture to you, to prove what a bleſſing it is to live in a good family, where either husband or wife, or any one in the family is godly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Wives be ſubject to your husbands,</hi> what then? <hi>that your husbands who are not wonne by the Word, may be wonne without the Word, whileſt they behold the converſation of their wives.</hi> A notable text, There were many wicked Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, that all the Sermons they heard would not convert them; yet the Apoſtle tells them, that if the wife did live a godly and holy life, their lives ſometimes ſhould be more efficacious to convert their Husbands, then the Word ſhould be. And this, Beloved, doth clearly take off this firſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115140:58"/>plea of yours, that becauſe you were converted by example, and by living among good Chriſtians, and ſeeing their walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, this gained upon you; this is no cauſe of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe ſometimes, (I ſay) the Lord doth bleſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of gracious lives, to make them winne and gain upon men that are brought home to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they go yet further, There is another poore ſoul brought home to Jeſus Chriſt, and what ſaith he? I do miſdoubt the means of my call, for a Sermon never wrought upon me, the firſt thing of all that ever gained upon me, it was the reading of ſome Chapters in the Bible, or ſome other holy mans book, and that made me firſt to hate ſin, and love the wayes of God, and look after his Word for my ſalvation. And here I doubt not but many Chriſtians have found the Word read, the firſt means of gaining upon their hearts. And therefore to take off this likewiſe, I ſhall ſpeak two or three things in way of Anſwer. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, that God is not tied to any means, but can work with the meaneſt means to bring home people to Jeſus Chriſt. If <hi>Peters</hi> converſion was by a Cock; a Cock crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a look of Chriſts eye, why may not Chriſt uſe the Scriptures read to be a means of a mans call? If from ſtones God can raiſe up children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> why cannot <hi>God</hi> do it by the Word alſo? to make the Word read a means in his own hands to effect it? God that can do all things with nothing, without means, can bring to paſſe great things by weak means.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and more particularly, That though ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily preaching, and hearing of the Word preached be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, and crowned by him chiefly to be a means inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to convert ſouls, yet God ſometimes hath bleſsed the reading of the Word to be a means of converting ſouls likewiſe. Yet Beloved, I would not do as the Prelates did, who would fain have brought in reading to juſtle out preaching. Preaching is the more noble work, and muſt be higheſt in our thoughts, yet if God will go out in an unuſual way, who can controll him? If God will do it by a Chapter,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115140:59"/>read, when not by a Sermon preached, who can reſiſt God? if he will ſhew his power by weaker means. Who ſhall gainſay it? God ſometimes honours the reading of the Word, to give encouragement to reading, to be a means of ſome mens call. I have read of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> that he was converted not by hearing a Sermon, but by opening the Bible, and reading that place. <hi>Rom</hi> 13.13. <hi>Let us walk honeſtly as in the day time, not in rioting and drunkenneſſe, not in chambering and wantonneſſe:</hi> and the reading of this verſe wrought upon him. I have read of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that he was converted by reading the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of <hi>Jonas,</hi> hearing of Gods mercy to ſave ſuch a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, and of Gods mercy to <hi>Jonas,</hi> when he was in ſo pettiſh a mood as to be angry with God. I have known like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe another famous Miniſter, that going by a Book-binders ſhop, he was converted by reading a Sermon of Repentance that coſt but two pence; &amp; hath bin a famous Miniſter ſince for the converſion of many hundreds to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Junius</hi> was converted by reading the firſt of <hi>John;</hi> ſo the Eunuch was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by reading <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. Beloved, God is not bound up to any one way in ſaving man; He that wrought upon <hi>Auſtin</hi> by a verſe reading &amp; upon another by a Sermon, he can do ſo by thee Reading is an ordinance of God, and God is not bound up, but may uſe that as ameans of thy effectual call likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Yea but, ſaith another doubting ſoul, Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture I was never wrought upon, neither by ſeeing god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people among whom I lived, and obſerving their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor was I wrought upon by reading good books; but I was firſt wrought upon by hearing ſuch a Miniſter, that I now ſee is run into error; or a Miniſter that is grown looſe in his practice (happily in theſe preſent times gone to joyne with the enemy againſt the Kingdom,) and become a wicked and vile liver; and the Miniſter being bad that wrought upon me, makes me queſtion, whether the work be not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and bad work alſo, and this gravels many a Chriſtian likewiſe. To which I anſwer briefly,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That ſuppoſe the Miniſter were bad that wrought upon thee, yet the badneſſe of the Miniſter is no juſt ground
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115140:59"/>of making us ſuſpect our calling. For then we ſhould never be ſure of our call. A man may be ſure of his own conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though a man may not be ſure of the converſion, of him by whoſe means he was called.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Again it is clear in Scripture, God may uſe Miniſters that are wicked themſelves to convert others. The Miniſters of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> doubtleſſe ſome of them were bad men; <hi>Paul</hi> tells you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>I keep under my body, leſt when I preach to others, I my ſelf may be a caſtaway.</hi> Intimating, that a man may preach to others, and may be a means to ſave others, and yet not be ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. Miniſters in this caſe may be as Cooks are. A Cook may dreſſe many a diſh, and let them go through his hands to furniſh a large and ſtately Table, yet of all theſe diſhes himſelf hardly taſte one; So Miniſters, they may dreſſe many a diſh for their hearers, yet they not lick their fingers, or taſte of this ſpiritual food themſelves. As in the building of the Ark, there were many men built <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, to ſave others, that were drowned themſelves; ſo many men may build an Ark by preaching the Word, and the wayes of God to ſave other mens ſoules, when they may be drowned themſelves. Hence it is the Scripture tells us of Starres that fell from Heaven; many Miniſters, that ſeemed godly Miniſters, like Starres in their Generation, yet they fell, and became wicked and looſe. And I remember Doctor <hi>Pembleton</hi> a famous Miniſter in the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and a man whoſe Miniſtry had converted many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yet at length he himſelf turned to be a Papiſt. Now theſe Chriſtians did never miſdoubt or ſuſpect their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe the man that converted them, was a bad man; They might be good people, though he was a bad Miniſter: ſo that this is no ground in the world; though I confeſſe it is not ordinary, that God makes wicked men meanes of converſion, but God ordinarily crowns the Word moſt in the mouth of a godly Miniſter, yet ſometimes I ſay, God may uſe a wicked man to be a means to convert ſoules. And I would give you theſe reaſons to prove, that a wicked
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115140:60"/>man may convert ſoules, and that God ties not converſion onely to a godly Miniſter. Becauſe firſt, the efficacy of the Word doth not depend upon man, but upon Jeſus Chriſt; and Chriſt may make uſe of whom he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If only a good man could convert, then this would follow, that we could be as well ſure of another mans converſion, as we are of our own; which is a thing moſt untrue. For if only a godly man could convert, then if I were ſure of my own converſion, I were as well ſure of his converſion that wrought upon me alſo; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, ſo that clearly this ſhould lay no block in your way, becauſe you diſcern the Miniſter that wrought upon you to be no good man, ſeeing converſion is not tied onely to a godly Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a third ground from whence doubts ariſe in called ones, is from ſome ſeeming defects they apprehend to be in the concomitants that accompany, or in the effects that ſhould follow effectual calling: and this makes them fear, that ſure they are not effectually called. I will name to you three or four.</p>
               <p>Firſt, (ſaith a doubting Chriſtian) I do hear in Scripture what effects will follow, and what will accompany a man effectually called, and I find them not wrought in my ſoul. As now firſt. I apprehend that when a man is effectually called, he ſhall be inabled by God to call upon him in prayer: I finde in Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. That <hi>all that are called to be Saints, they ſhall call upon the Lord in every place;</hi> but alas, wo is me, I do not find this in my ſoul. I find I have a dull, dead, liſtleſſe, unpraying heart all the dayes of my life; and therefore I doubt whether I am effectually called or no. Now to this I ſhall lay down three things for anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, peradventure you judge that you are not enabled to pray, becauſe you want expreſſions in prayer, though you have affections. Now if you judge your inability to pray, becauſe you want expreſſions only, you judge amiſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe prayer is to be judged by the affections, not by the expreſſions. Expreſſions they are but the breath of nature,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115140:60"/>a natural voluble tongue may tumble out expreſſions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as affections in prayer, they are the breath and fruit of the holy Spirit. Therefore do not judge you cannot pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have not ſuch fluent expreſſions as others uſe, for the very eſſence of a prayer lies in the heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, when the Spirit of God teacheth men to pray, it teacheth them not only in expreſſions, but <hi>with ſighs and groans that cannot be uttered. Rom.</hi> 8.26. When the Spirit moves the heart, and makes you ſigh out your requeſts, and ſorrow out your ſupplications, you pray beſt of all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you that judge your inability to pray, and therefore think you are not called, becauſe you cannot call upon God, I would ſay this unto you: That the beſt of Gods children have found a great difference in their ſpirits in reference to praying duties; the beſt of Gods children do not alwayes pray alike. Sometimes the affections of godly men are as ſwift in prayer, as the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab;</hi> otherwhiles they drive as heavily as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots when the wheels were off. Sometime the people of God are burning in their affections, hot as fire; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles they are frozen in their affections, cold as ice. None of Gods people are in their carriage alwayes alike towards God in prayer. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.4. It is the ſpeech of <hi>Aſaph, O Lord, my ſpirit is overwhelmed within me, I am ſore troubled, I cannot ſpeak.</hi> The man was ſo troubled, he could not ſpeak, yet <hi>Aſaph</hi> ſpake theſe words with his mouth; but the meaning is, though <hi>Aſaph</hi> was a godly man, yet he was ſo overwhelmed with trouble, he could not ſpeak to God, he could not call upon God with that inward vigor of ſpirit. Though thou mayeſt ſometime call upon God with affection, yet when trouble reſts upon thee, thy heart may be out of frame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, many times Gods people are ſubject to a ſtate of deſertion, and abatements in their ſpiritual affections, and then they are out of a praying vein; when you looſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the wheels of prayer are knocked off. Many times it falls out with Gods people, that they are even brought into
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115140:61"/>a languiſhing and low condition, they are in ſuch a ſwoune as if they had neither a principle, nor the actings of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. verſe 2. <hi>Strengthen that which remaines,</hi> ſaith the holy Ghoſt; <hi>that is ready to die.</hi> Godly people may bee a dying people, and then the tongue failes, when it is a dying: the people of God may be in a dying condition; though they never die wholly in grace, yet they may be ſo weakned in their ſpirits, that they cannot poure out their requeſts to God as in wonted time. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Jehoſaphat he walked in the firſt wayes of David his father:</hi> implying that <hi>Davids</hi> firſt wayes were better then his laſt. So many men may have their firſt wayes good, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the end before they die, they may have much fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deadneſſe of ſpirit upon them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If a man doth but mourn, that he cannot call upon God, God looks upon that as calling upon him. If you can but ſigh out your requeſts, and mourn that you cannot mourn, and pray that you might pray; the Lord hears your prayer. This is the moſt melodious muſick you can make in the eares of God. Therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping:</hi> There is a voice in Teares, as well as in Words. If the Lord ſee thee to weep over thine own ſtraitneſſe, and mourn over thine own dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Lord looks upon this with a more pleaſing eye, then if thou couldſt poure out the inlargements of thy tongue, with moſt fluent and voluble expreſſions.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Doctrine which I am yet upon is this, <hi>That Chriſtians ought to put forth a great deal of diligence to make this ſure to their ſouls, that they are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In the proſecution of which I have gone over many particulars, and anſwered ſome doubts, in reſerence to godly men who are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called. As firſt, in regard of ſome ſeeming defects they apprehend to be in the manner of their calling. Secondly, in the means of their calling. And thirdly, (which I am yet upon,) of ſome defects they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend about the concomitants that accompany thoſe that are effectually called, of which I have ſpoken onely of one in particular, to wit, that they cannot call upon God in prayer; I now paſſe to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They apprehend that thoſe that are effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, they have this to accompany their calling, that they are brought out of a ſtate of ignorance into a ſtate of knowledge, out of a ſtate of darkneſſe into a ſtate of light; hence they will urge this againſt themſelves, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Ye are to ſhew forth the praiſes of him, who hath call'd you out of darkneſſe into his marvellous light.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. He ſent forth his Word <hi>to call them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Now ſaith the poor ſoul, Alas, I do not finde this concomitant to be in my heart, I do not finde this marvellous light the Scripture here ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 6. Alas, my heart is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115140:62"/>like a dungeon of darkneſſe, and like a houſe that hath no inlets, no windows to let in the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel upon it: and many times this gravelleth many a godly minde. Now to thoſe that make this doubt, I ſhall onely ſpeak two or three things to take it off.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to you that make this complaint, I would ſay this: that thoſe that know moſt, they know but little in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſt; as you are not perfect in other graces, ſo you are not here perfect in knowledg; <hi>You know but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.9. therefore you have no need to be diſcouraged at this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and more particularly, you that complain of ignorance; though you are ignorant, and cannot finde that marvellous light ſhine in your ſouls, which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, yet if your ignorance have not theſe three ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, you may reſt confident your ignorance will never prove a damning ſinne unto you, but it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with your effectual calling; As</p>
               <p>Firſt, If you ignorance be not a ſtubborne and wilfull ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Secondly, If it be not a ſottiſh and brutiſh ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. And thirdly, If it be not a fundamental ignorance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If it be not a ſtubborne and wilfull ignorance. Though you are ignorant, yet if you are willing to learn, and know the wayes of God revealed in his Word, ſuch an ignorance will never damne you: But when ignorance comes to be wilful, that a man doth not know, and he will not learne; a man is an ignorant man yet he thinks he knows more then all the Preachers can tell him; this is a ſad ſigne you are not effectually called. Hence you read, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22. <hi>How long, ye ſimple ones, will you love ſimplicity, &amp;c?</hi> Godly people may be in a ſtate of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but they love it not; therefore, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. the Scripture tells us of wicked men, that <hi>they are wilfully ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</hi> So that if your ignorance have not this bad quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it, to be a ſtubborne and wilfull ignorance, it may ſtand with your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Provided that your ignorance be not a ſottiſh and brutiſh ignorance; that is, that you do not ſo lie cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115140:62"/>in a ſtate of darkneſſe, that you are uncapable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the goodneſſe of the Word, and uncapable to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend any thing that is taught you; that you are not like thoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.22. <hi>My people have no underſtanding, they are a ſottiſh people, wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no underſtanding.</hi> Many men are ignorant men, yet not ſo ſottiſhly ignorant, as not to be capable of learning; if you will teach him, he is willing to be inſtructed; but ſome men are ſo ignorant, they are not capable of learning; you may as well teach a block as them. Hence it is the Prophet complains, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.4. <hi>The Oxe knows his owner, and the Aſſe his Maſters Crib, but Iſrael knows not the Lord his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In caſe your ignorance be not a fundamental ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, I mean ſuch an ignorance, as not to know thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and fundamental points in the Word, that muſt be known, if ever you be ſaved; as about Jeſus Chriſt and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and juſtification by his blood, and faith in his Name, &amp;c. though you may be ignorant about circumſtantials, yet if it be not in fundamentals, your ignorance may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with effectual calling. But now</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a godly man be ſatisfied in theſe two points, and thinks happily, I may have the firſt concomitant, to call upon God, and ſo evidence my effectual call; and then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the ſecond may not be wanting in me, that I do not lie under the ſtate of a wilful ſottiſh &amp; fundamental ignorance. But alas, ſaith he, I want a third concomitant that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies effectual calling, and that is; I finde in the Word, that they that are effectually called, they are brought into an Obediential frame of heart to all the wayes of God, that whatever God commands them to do, their hearts can readily obey, and this I finde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>God hath called them by his grace unto the obedience of faith.</hi> Now alas, ſaith a poore ſoul. I finde a defect in this concomitant likewiſe, I cannot diſcerne that I am called to an obedience flowing from faith as its principle, I cannot finde this frame of heart to be in me, and therefore I doubt of my effectual calling This I ſhall labour to take off likewiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:115140:63"/>Firſt, When I ſay that obedience is a concomitant that will accompany one effectually called, I do not ſay nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it of obedience in the actings of it, but of an obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial frame of ſpirit in the purpoſes of it. Many men may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called,
<note place="margin">In praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione animi.</note> when they may not alwayes live in the acting of obedience to Chriſt but every man effectually called hath an obedient frame of heart; that is, he hath purpoſes &amp; inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reſolutions to obey God, though he cannot act what he would do; he hath obedience in the habit, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his purpoſes and reſolutions always attending him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you finde in Scripture, that the ſtrongeſt and ableſt Chriſtians who have done moſt for God, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been very defective in the Actings of obedience, that they could not do what they would do for God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> complaines, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>The good that we would do, we cannot do. Paul</hi> himſelf that was a pillar in Gods houſe, yet he tells you, he could not go out in thoſe Actings of obedience, which in his heart he would do; &amp; therfore if you would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly do more then you do, God accepts of the litle you do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though you cannot put forth many Actings of obedience to God; where there is readineſſe of minde and heart, God accepts the purpoſes of the minde for the Action it ſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Where there is a willing minde, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, as if the deed were done.</hi> And thus much be ſpoken to the ſecond caſe of conſcience, why men effectually called do ſo much doubt of their own call.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doubt. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, Seeing Chriſtians muſt put forth diligence in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their calling ſure; therefore now whereabouts muſt this diligence of ours be converſant? or into what Channel muſt our diligence run, that ſo we might be ſure of our effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling? This is a very material queſtion; and in reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, I ſhall anſwer it in theſe two generals.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if you would get aſſurance of your effectual calling, you muſt put forth diligence to remove thoſe things that will hinder you in making ſure your calling. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, uſe diligence to ſet upon the practice of thoſe duties that may further you in making this ſure, that you are effectually called.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:115140:63"/>Firſt, You muſt remove thoſe things which do much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from being aſſured, and thoſe hinderances that are to be removed, I ſhall comprize under ſix heads; As</p>
               <p>Firſt, you muſt uſe diligence to remove Melancholy from your Thoughts; This is a natural hinderance of aſſurance. Melancholy is a temper in man ariſing from a black blood running about the body, that doth naturally occaſion diſtruſt and fear in mens mindes; this temper being in the body, doth work much upon the diſpoſition of the ſoul. Now if your temper be Melancholy, and ſo diſpoſe you to diſtruſt and fear, this will be a great ſtop to your having of the joyes and comforts of the Lord in your hearts, in aſſurance of his love. It is a note <hi>Perkins</hi> hath upon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when he are graſſe like a beaſt; he writing upon that place thinks, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was in a deep Melancholy, and that did ſo poſſeſſe him, that he could not tell whether he was a man or a beaſt, though ſaith he, he did not eat graſſe, but his deep perplexity ſeazing upon him did make him think that he was from a man turned into a Beaſt. Beloved, Melancholy in a Chriſtian, it will make him think himſelf an Hypocrite, when he is a Saint; and therefore take heed of a Melancholy, lumpiſh and ſad temper; it is a very great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to this grace of aſſurance. This I lay down only as a Natural remedy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A minde filled with worldly cares, and running into incumbring imployments in the world, this is a great hinderance of aſſurance. The cares of this life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. are compared to thornes. Now thornes they choake the ſeed, by drawing the juyce that is in the ſeed to themſelves, and ſo the corn doth not grow, where thornes ſpring. The cares of this life, they are like thornes in this, they are of an attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power, to ſuck and draw the juyce of your ſpirits and comforts to themſelves, ſo that you cannot have the juyce of your ſpirits in gathering your evidences for heaven; the more incumbred you are in the world, the leſſe clear you will be touching the evidence of your everlaſting condition; The cares of this life, <hi>they pierce the ſoul through with many
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115140:64"/>ſorrowes.</hi> Now when a man is pierced with many ſorrows, he is in a very unfit temper to be raiſed up in ſpiritual joy; the more you encumber your ſelves in the employments of this world, the leſs you wil be in the comforts of heaven. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it was the ſpeech of a Pope when he lay a dying, When I was a painful preaching Miniſter, then I had hopes of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; when I came to be a Cardinal, I doubted of it: but when I came to be a Pope, I deſpaired of it; I was ſo entangled in the Affairs of this life: Beloved, ſo I may ſay to you, When you were but ordinary Chriſtians in the world, you were in a way to get aſſurance of your ſalvation, but ſince you have been taken up with the affaires of the world, it doth ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract your minde, that you can be in no compoſed temper to have any ſetledneſſe of heart about your everlaſting eſtate. It is the obſervation of Philoſophers, that the Sun is eclipſed by the interpoſition of the Moon, the Moon coming between the Sun and our ſight: Beloved, the Sun of your comforts comes to be eclipſed by the Moon, (which is made an Emblem of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9.) Now if the Moon of the world comes between your comforts and you, it will miſerably darken and eclipſe your comforts to you. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world doth ſo impede your comfort in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as incumbring and carking cares about the things of this world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Take heed you do not harbour the guilt of any one known ſin upon your conſcience. Keeping of ſin upon the conſcience, is a great impediment to your inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. You will never be aſſured while you do thus; and therefore if ever you would have aſſurance, remove this. It is an obſervation of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hilderſham</hi> upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12, 14. What doth <hi>David</hi> do, when he prayes for aſſurance? ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Reſtore to me the joyes of thy ſalvation, eſtabliſh me with thy free Spirit;</hi> Reſtore my comforts, and my evidences to me. And what courſe doth he take? Read verſe 14. <hi>Deliver me from blood-guiltineſſe, O Lord.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, All the while that ſin lay upon conſcience unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, (as it did for nine monthes together) all that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115140:64"/>while <hi>David</hi> loſt the joyes of the Spirit, and loſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Heaven; And therefore when he comes to renew his comforts, and reſtore his aſſurance, he doth with begging of God for aſſurance, beg of God alſo to deliver him from blood-guiltineſſe; as knowing, that if this ſin ſhould be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſcience unrepented of, and unpardoned, he ſhould never have the joyes of Gods Spirit reſtored. Beloved, you will never have aſſurance of your effectual calling, till your conſciences are freed from having ſin upon them with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. It is an obſervation that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath about earth-quakes, that they are occaſioned by reaſon of winde got into the Caverns and hollow places of the earth; which having no place for vent again, it makes ruptures, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes houſes and mountaines and all before it: Sin upon the conſcience unrepented of, is like winde in the earth, it will make a heart quake there, that there ſhall not be that calmneſſe, and quietneſſe, and ſetledneſſe of minde which there would be, were ſinne away. Hence we read, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 33.16. <hi>The ſinners in Sion are afraid, and fearfulneſſe hath ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed the Hypocrite,</hi> The ſinners are afraid; thoſe who had guilt upon them, their ſins bred terrour and ſeare; and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites that are conſcious to themſelves of their own guilt, fearfulneſſe ſurprizeth them, but the upright and ſincere in heart were not ſo; To note that this is a great enemy to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace, and to aſſurance about your everlaſting eſtate, if ſo be you harbour ſin upon the conſcience unrepented of. And it is juſt with God it ſhould be ſo; becauſe if you keep ſin in your hearts, that will be ever jarring with heaven, it is juſt with God to be at oddes with you.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Avoid the caſting of your eye, in a way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, upon others, who are more eminent in grace then you, and have got a precedencie of you in the wayes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. 'Tis true indeed, a man that is given to ſpiritual pride, and ſelfe-conceitedneſſe touching his own goodneſſe, it is fit that he ſhould look upon thoſe that have a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie before him in grace, the more to humble him: But for a man that lies under trouble of minde, and doubtings touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115140:65"/>his everlaſting eſtate, that man ſhould not look upon others more eminent then he in grace, becauſe it will rather increaſe diſcomforts, then any way work aſſurance in you. If you look upon the glittering beames of the Sun ſhining in its full ſtrength, the more you look upon that orient and reſplendent body, the more it will dazle your eyes, that you can behold but dimly things upon the earth: It is ſo with Chriſtians; ſome Chriſtians they ſhine like ſo many Suns in the firmament, their graces do ſo ſhine and ſparkle, that if you look upon them, they will even dazle your eyes, and make you blinde, that you cannot ſee thoſe ſmall ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ſparks of grace that are in your own hearts. In caſe therefore you would get aſſurance, avoid the caſting of your eye too much upon thoſe that have a precedencie in grace before you.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take heed you make not ſenſe and feeling the Touchſtone to try your effectual calling by; ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will deceive you in the matters of your calling. I may allude to that paſſage in the book of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> you know old <hi>Iſaac</hi> was dimme-ſighted, and by reaſon of his old age, he ran into a miſtake by feeling; He had <hi>Jacob</hi> by the hand, and by feeling thought it had been <hi>Eſau.</hi> Beloved, many of us are dimme-ſighted in our comforts, and in our graces, and if we truſt to feeling, we may be deceived as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was. You may think when you have <hi>Jacob</hi> by the hand, I mean grace in the heart, that it is but an <hi>Eſau,</hi> it is but a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Therefore take heed of making ſenſe and feeling the Touchſtone to try your calling by. A childe is born, yet knowes not that it is born; lives, yet knowes not that it lives; but thoſe about it do: ſo a Chriſtian may be born again, live the life of grace, and yet not be ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Give diligence to remove this hinderance, to wit, Pride in your gifts, and dependance upon your graces. Pride and dependance, they are not onely murderers of comforts, but they murder our graces alſo; and if God ſees you ſwell with pride, becauſe you abound in grace, he will ſoon prick that ſwelling bladder. It is the obſervation of a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115140:65"/>Modern Divine, that exaltings of ſpirit after aſſurance at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it will inevitably expoſe a Chriſtian, either to great diſcomforts, or to great ſins. Hence the Scripture makes mention, that Pride of your gifts is not onely an enemy to comfort, but an enemy to grace; not onely an enemy to the comforts from grace, but to the very having of grace. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>If a mans heart be exalted, his ſpirit is not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right within him.</hi> James 4.6. <hi>God reſiſts the proud,
<note place="margin">Job 40.7.</note> and gives grace to the humble.</hi> So that pride is not onely an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to your comforts, but to the very getting of grace like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; when the branches of a vine grow luxuriant, they ſhall have the pruning hook. And thus you have the firſt ſort of helps laid down to you; In caſe you would get aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, you muſt uſe diligence to avoid thoſe things that may be a hinderance to you in getting aſſurance of your call.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſecond ſort of helps in caſe you would get aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, is to uſe diligence in the practice of thoſe things that may be helps and furtherances to the obtaining of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance about your effectual calling. And here I ſhall name onely ſix or ſeven particulars</p>
               <p>Firſt, Exalt arguments of faith againſt preſent feelings; If ſo be that you will once enter the liſts to diſpute with the devil, he will out-cavill you, and <hi>Non-plus</hi> you. The devil is a cunning Logician, and it is not ſafe, ſaith D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Preſton,</hi> to argue with the devil; the devil will out-diſpute, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argue you. It is a Chriſtians work to exalt arguments of Faith againſt preſent feelings. In caſe you would get aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, you are to do as <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful did, when he was to believe a thing that ſenſe and reaſon would tell him ſhould never come to paſſe; It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19. That <hi>in hope he believed againſt hope.</hi> He would exalt faith againſt ſenſe. And how was it? God promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> a childe; reaſon and ſenſe would have told <hi>Abraham, Abraham,</hi> thou art a hundred yeers old, thy wife ninety nine, her womb is barren, and it is not likely you ſhould have children; but <hi>Abraham</hi> would not argue thus,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115140:66"/>but would exalt arguments of faith, and apply Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and Gods Word, exalting theſe; <hi>Abraham</hi> did believe in hope againſt hope. Beloved, ſo muſt you: though you ſay you have barren wombs, Grace is not likely to grow in you, and though you are old, and decrepit, &amp; feeble Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yet advance arguments of faith from Gods love, and from Gods power, and from Gods Providence, and Gods Promiſes, and that's the way to get your comforts clear and full. I may apply what <hi>Fox</hi> in his Acts and Monuments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of a poor woman, that was called before <hi>Bonner,</hi> and the reſt in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign that ſate in Judgement about her Religion; they ſee her, though a poor and ſilly woman, yet keep firm to her principles, and would not deny her Religion. At length <hi>Bonner</hi> ſent ſome learned Doctors to diſpute with her, and argue the caſe about ſome points ſhe held; they coming to ſee her, ſhe puts them off with this ſaying, Well, you are Scholars, and you come to diſpute; I muſt needs tell you, I cannot diſpute, but I can burn for my Religion. Beloved, I would have you anſwer the devil thus. If he comes to outwit and cavill with you about your comforts, ſay you cannot diſpute, but you can believe; you can lay your help on Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>upon one that is mighty,</hi> and exalt arguments of faith, and this will much ſtrengthen your comforts. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.42. <hi>There came a Ruler to Jeſus Chriſt, and beſought him for his daughter that lay a dying;</hi> and while he was telling Chriſt this, there came ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meſſenger after, and told him, <hi>Thy daughter is dead, trouble the man no farther:</hi> what ſaith Chriſt hearing this? <hi>Fear not, onely believe.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, ſenſe and reaſon would have told him it were a needleſſe thing to beg of Chriſt for his daughter when ſhe was dead; but ſaith Chriſt, Do not ſtoop to ſenſe and reaſon, <hi>Fear not, onely believe,</hi> and the work ſhall be done: So I ſay to you, Conſult not with fleſh and blood, but exalt arguments of faith againſt preſent feelings; and this is the way to get aſſurance of your comforts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Keep conſcience clear, that no ſin be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115140:66"/>there, and you are in the way to get your comforts full. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 85.8. <hi>will ſpeak peace to his people, but they muſt not return unto folly.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, though God doth ſpeak peace, and aſſure you of your pardon and ſalvation; yet if you return to ſin, God can tell how to break your peace, and turn his ſmiles into frowns and angry looks. Take heed of ſin, and keep your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence clear, and that's the way to have peace ſetled in your hearts. <hi>Job</hi> 11.14, 15. <hi>If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedneſſe dwell in thy Tabernacle.</hi> What followes? <hi>and then ſhalt thou lift up thy face before God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt, and ſhalt not fear.</hi> A ſtrange expreſſion, That if you will keep ſin far away, then you ſhall be ſtedfaſt before God, and not fear; that is, you ſhall not be expoſed to thoſe fears and doubts and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which other men are expoſed to. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near to God with an upright heart, in fall aſſurance of faith.</hi> Now what ſhall a man do to come to God in full aſſurance? Mark the next words, <hi>Draw nigh to God in full aſſurance of faith, having your hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience.</hi> Here is the way, if you are ſprinkled from an evill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, you may be bold to come to God in full aſſurance. Whereas, alas, if thy conſcience tell thee, thou art a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and thou art a deceiver, and a liar, and looſe liver, thou canſt not come with full aſſurance; thou mayeſt come in preſumption indeed, but not with the aſſurance of faith: and therefore keep a conſcience clear from harbouring guilt upon it, and that's the way to have the heart ſull of joy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, be diligent in keeping company with the moſt godly experienced Chriſtians where you live, this is a very ſpecial way to increaſe your comforts. Ye read an excellent paſſage, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.4. <hi>We are comforted of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that we might comfort others with the comfort wherewith we are comforted of God.</hi> Godly Chriſtians they will comfort you with the ſame comforts wherewith they themſelves are comforted. <hi>If we are comforted, it is for your conſolation.</hi> Godly men if they have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115140:67"/>comfort from God, they will impart their experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to you, and tell you as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>What God hath done for their ſoul.</hi> There is no way better then this, to keep in communion with godly and knowing Chriſtians. Maſter <hi>Bradford</hi> that famous Martyr who was in priſon about his profeſſion of Chriſt, the ſtory ſaith he lay a long time under trouble of minde, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of conſcience, that he could not finde a real and clear evidence of his effectual calling: there came many men to him, and could not ſettle him. Yet a poore Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, an ancient and experienced Chriſtian, that did uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accompany Maſter <hi>Bradford</hi> in priſon, by his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent communion with this poore man, he got more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort then ever he got all his life before. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, this I ſpeak to you to make you the more to ſtudy the worth of godly ſociety, and the more you are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with Chriſtians that live in the enjoyment of the light of Gods countenance, and in the aſſurance of his favour all the day long, the more you are in the ready way to increaſe your comforts and aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Submit thy ſelf to the approbation of others, and be willing to have them paſs a verdict upon thee. When thou art a ſleep or in a ſwoun, then thou canſt not tel thyſelf what thou doſt, but others muſt tell thee; So it may fall out with the godly; they may be in ſuch a ſpiritual ſwoun that the yare not fit judges of their own condition; in this caſe ſubmit to the judgement of others, they may ſee grace in thee when thou thy ſelf canſt not ſee it; ſo Maſter <hi>Throgmorton</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by the Teſtimony of a company of godly Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Live in the daily improvement of grace, and that's the way to get aſſurance. And this meanes the holy Ghoſt layes down in the Chapter, out of which my text is taken, <hi>Adde grace to grace.</hi> And I remember that <hi>Beza</hi> upon this text doth write, that in the Greek Tranſlations, theſe words are put in, <hi>Give diligence by good works to make your calling ſure:</hi> whether it be ſo or no, I cannot affirm, but this I am ſure of, and the context will clearly prove it,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115140:67"/>that the way to make your calling ſure, is to adde grace to grace. For after the Apoſtle had ſpoken of adding grace to grace, he comes in with this, <hi>Give diligence to make your calling ſure:</hi> Implying, that the more you live in the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of grace, the more you ſhall live in the enjoyment of comforts. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>The works of righteouſneſſe ſhall be peace.</hi> Not the habit, but the work; if you act righteouſneſs, and live in the workings and thrivings in grace, this ſhall be peace, and the effect of it quietneſſe and aſſurance for ever. So <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>The more you pray, the more you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your joy.</hi> So that the more you live in the improvement of grace, the more likely way you are into get aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If you would get aſſurance, ſpend more time in ſtrengthening your evidences for heaven, then in queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. It is the great fault of many Chriſtians, they will ſpend much time in queſtioning and not in ſtrengthening their comforts. They will reaſon themſelves into unbeliefe, and ſay, Lord, why ſhould I believe? why ſhould I take hold of a promiſe? that am ſo unholy and ſo unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a creature? And ſo by this they reaſon themſelves to ſuch a paſſe, that they dare not lay hold upon Chriſt; whereas it ſhould be your work to reaſon your ſelves into Chriſt as much as you can. Labour to ſtrengthen your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; and reaſon thus, Why ſhould I not believe in Chriſt? Thus <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>Why art thou troubled O my ſoul, and why art thou caſt down within me.</hi> Is not the mercy of God more then ſin in the creature? Is not there free grace, where there is guilt. Are not there pardoning mercies, where condemnation is deſerved? you ſhould reaſon up your comforts rather then reaſon them down; and ſpend more time in ſtrengthening? then in queſtioning of them. You would count him a very unwiſe man, that hath a Leaſe of ſo much land, and he himſelfe ſhall create ſcruples and doubts, and ſhall uſe no means to make his title good: And truly many Chriſtians are as unwiſe for heaven; They have, as I may ſay, good bond and ſeal that God will bring them to heaven, and yet they will queſtion,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115140:68"/>and cavill themſelves into unbeliefe. Beloved, this ſhould not be, but you ought rather to ſtrengthen your comforts, then queſtion them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Be diligent in the earneſt ſtudy of the Covenant of grace: Beloved, all a Chriſtians doubts ariſe from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Covenant of grace. And here that I may ſpeak a little to it, I beſeech you follow me, ſtudy the Covenant of grace; which if you do, you ſhall diſcern five particular props in it to bear up your hearts againſt diſcomforts, and to ſtrengthen you in a way of aſſurance touching your ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual call.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Covenant of works it commands perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience upon pain of damnation; but the Covenant of grace doth command and accept of imperfect obedience, if it be ſincere: there's your firſt prop.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Covenant of works is not contented with good deſires, unleſſe there be good deeds; the Covenant of grace accepts the good will and good deſires, when the deed is wanting, and is content with the will for the deed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Covenant of works doth require that you ſhould obey the will of God perfectly in your own perſon; the Covenant of grace requires onely that you obey in the perſon of Chriſt; ſo Chriſt obeyes for you, it is accepted, though you do not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Covenant of works requires you to obey the whole will of God by your own ſtrength; the Covenant of grace accepts of it, though not our own ſtrength, but the ſtrength of Chriſt be put forth in doing any ſpiritual action.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Covenant of works requires the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the condition, before it gives the Promiſe; As, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> you cannot live, ſaith the Covenant of works, without you do this: but the Covenant of grace, it firſt tenders the Promiſe, and then requires the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Bids you firſt take Chriſt, and firſt Believe, and then ſhew forth the effects of faith. Firſt, lay hold upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and then hold forth and practiſe the condition of that Promiſe. Firſt believe, and firſt take Chriſt, though
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115140:68"/>thou art unworthy, and art a wretched creature, if after taking of him thou wilt be conſciencious to practiſe thoſe obligations this lies upon thee, and I will accept thee. Now would you lay theſe to your heart, to ſtudy that vaſt difference between the Covenant of works and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, doubtleſſe theſe would be great props for your inward comforts.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE point of Doctrine I am yet upon in the proſecution of theſe words, is this: <hi>That Chriſtians ought to put forth a great deale of diligence to make this ſure to their ſoules, that they are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt to grace and glory.</hi> In the handling of which I have gone over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars, and reſolved ſeveral caſes of conſcience: I have yet two caſes more to reſolve, and then ſhall winde up all in a general uſe. Therefore</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When, or at what time doth God fill the ſoules of his people moſt with this aſſurance of their effectual calling? And then</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Wherein lies the difference between that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance a godly man hath of his effectuall calling, and thoſe preſumptuous perſwaſions that wicked men have, that they are called effectually, when they are not.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when, or at what time doth God give to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moſt and ſtrongeſt aſſurance of their effectual calling? And here in anſwer to this, I ſhall comprize all I have to ſay under four heads; that in four caſes or times God doth uſually give to his people moſt ſtrong aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, After the Lord hath greatly humbled the hearts of his people, and broken them for ſinne, then doth he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115140:69"/>uſually give in moſt aſſurance of a mans effectual calling, and of the happineſſe of his future condition. When you can ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.3. <hi>There is no reſt in my bones, by reaſon of my ſinne.</hi> When you can ſay as the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> doth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Let the bones which thou haſt broken, rejoyce.</hi> Then is the time for God to make you break forth with joy, when he hath broken your hearts with ſorrow. God had broken <hi>Davids</hi> heart under the ſenſe of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe he had committed: O ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Thou haſt broken my heart, now let my broken ſpirit rejoyce; and God gave him comfort, and did reſtore the joy of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to him. You have a phraſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.18. <hi>The Lord it nigh to them that are of a broken heart, to ſave them that are of a contrite ſpirit.</hi> The Lord is nigh to them. Nigh, what to do? not onely to give them deliverance from outward troubles, but from inward ſorrows; to give them inward joy, and inward comforts, <hi>that the bones which he hath broken might rejoyce.</hi> The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken ſpirit, to give them comfort. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. It's ſaid there, that <hi>the Spirit of the Lord was upon Chriſt,</hi> what to do? It was <hi>to binde up the broken in heart, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thoſe that mourn.</hi> So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61.1.2, 3. <hi>To thoſe that mourn, he ſhould preach comfort, and binde up the broken-hearted.</hi> When the Lord hath broken you under ſinne, and humbled you under the ſight of your evils, then is the time when God will break in upon you with greateſt joy. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all you that are weary, and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt;</hi> Reſt there, hath not onely reference to our reſt in heaven, that we ſhall reſt there from ſinne, and reſt there from ſorrow, and reſt there from temptation, but <hi>I will give you reſt;</hi> it hath reference alſo to a promiſe in this life, that if you are heavy laden, that you count your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities a burden too heavy for you to bear, Chriſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed you peace, inward peace in your own conſciences, in the aſſurance of your everlaſting eſtate, in aſſurance that you are called to a ſtate of grace, and ſhall come to a ſtate of glory. You know when the ground is plowed, the clods
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115140:70"/>are broken, and the breaking of the clods makes way for the deeper rooting of the corn, and that it may ſpring up with greater increaſe. It is ſo when ye <hi>plow up,</hi> in the Prophets Language, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. <hi>the fallow ground of your hearts;</hi> when you break the clods of your hearts by humiliation, this makes way for the corn and grain, that precious grain of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to ſpring and grow up to a fuller meaſure; ſo that you are out of Gods way then to have ſtrong aſſurance, that never have been humbled in the ſight of ſinne. I ſay, it's Gods ordinary way. I do not deny but God may bring you to heaven, though you have no legal workings and horrors upon you; yet God will never give you ſuch ſtrong aſſurance, and ſuch raviſhing comforts, as he gives them that are moſt broken in ſpirit. Look through the whole verge of Scripture, and you ſhall finde that thoſe that were moſt broken in heart, they were moſt ſtrong in comfort. That houſe that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th the deepeſt foundation, is likely to be the moſt beautiful Fabrick and building; whereas your tents and leſſer cottages, a little rooting in the earth will ſerve their turn: It is likely God may make thee as a little cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, though not deeply rooted; but thou wilt never be reared up a beautiful building, to become an amiable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in point of comfort and aſſurance, if God have not bottomed thee low in humiliation. It's a true rule in grace, <hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy.</hi> The deeper you are in ſorrow, the higher you ſhall be lifted up in joy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after the people of God have been toſſed and tumbled, and turmoiled with the violent aſſaults and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of the devil, then is Gods time of filling his people with greateſt joy and moſt comfort. You know at the Mill, at the Floodgate, when the ſtream goes ſtrongeſt, then the Mill goes faſteſt. Beloved, God lets the ſtream of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation grow ſtrong againſt thee, but to make thy Mill to go, to make thee grinde thy luſts to powder, and to make thee grinde thy ſinnes as corn under the Millſtone. God doth but make the flood to be ſtrong at the gate, to make thy comforts to be more ſtrong, and thy graces to be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115140:70"/>more firm. When God lets in a flood of temptation, and toſſeth thee upon thoſe waves and billows, then is the time for God to give thee in ſtrongeſt comforts. <hi>Eſa</hi> 54.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>O thou afflicted, toſſed with Tempeſt, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</hi> Mark their eſtate. Now what will God do with a ſoul thus toſſed with a Temptation? Read the verſe before, <hi>My Covenant of peace ſhall not depart from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, O thou afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> God doth here ſpeak moſt peace, and tenders moſt freely his Covenant in this condition, when they were moſt toſſed and tumbled. And verſe 13. <hi>Thy children ſhall be all taught of God, and great ſhall be their peace.</hi> And verſe 14. <hi>In righteouſneſſe thou ſhall be eſtabliſhed, and thou ſhalt not fear.</hi> Here you ſee how God as it were boulſters and beares up a dejected heart; <hi>O thou toſſed with a Tempeſt, Behold, I have made a Covenant of peace with thee,</hi> and <hi>Behold, thy children ſhall have peace,</hi> and <hi>Behold, thou ſhalt not fear.</hi> See how God keeps up the hearts of his people in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; when you are moſt toſſed and tumbled with the tempeſt of temptation, then doth God ordinarily ſpeak to you moſt inward peace and ſtrongeſt aſſurance. As you know it is with an Oake, the more they are ſhaken by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous windes, the firmer and faſter are they rooted in the bowels of the earth: It is ſo with Chriſtians; they are compared in Scripture to an Oak, whoſe fruit and ſap is in them: Now a Chriſtian, the more he is ſhaken by a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous temptation, the Lord makes him by that to be the more firm, and to be the more faſtened and ſetled in ſtrong comforts and aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when God hath any extraordinary work for his people, either to do or ſuffer, this is a time when he fills his people with moſt aſſurance. Should God put his people upon outward ſufferings, and give them inward fears, they were not in a capacity to undergo the condition with joy or patience: and therefore when he calls his people to ſome extraordinary meaſure of ſuffering, this is the time when God will fill them with more then ordinary comforts I have read in the book of Martyrs of Mr <hi>Robert Glover,</hi> a famous
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115140:71"/>man in his generation, who during the time of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was much troubled in minde for want of his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet the ſtory tells us, when he was brought to the ſtake to be burnt, aſſoon as ever he ſaw the fire, he broke out in the hearing of the people, and ſaid, He is come, he is come; I am now as full of joy as my heart can hold. All the while he was in priſon, he was blubbring and much troubled, till God brought him to an eminent ſuffering, to ſuffer death for him, and then he was full of comfort. I have read alſo of one <hi>Adolphus Clarebachius,</hi> who was a man ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Melancholy, and lay under many doubts and fears, yet aſſoon as ever he was brought to the ſtake, he openly declared to the people, I have been naturally of a ſad Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but now I profeſſe before you all, I think there is not a merrier heart in all the world then mine is. Thus they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go through extraordinary ſufferings, God gave them extraordinary aſſurance. Beloved, this is Gods time, when he will give you moſt aſſurance, when he calls you to moſt ſufferings. When you are to go through an Ocean of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and afflictions, the Lord will make you ſwim in a Sea of inward peace and ſpiritual joyes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God gives his people moſt ſtrong aſſurance, when they walk moſt cloſely in communion with their God. <hi>Great peace ſhall they have,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, that love thy law;</hi> they ſhall have peace, and great peace, while they walk in love to God and his wayes. Keep in communion with your God, and that's the time for God to give you in greateſt comfort; If ye laſh out from God and break his law, he will break your hearts. When the ſhepheard hath a Lamb, or a Sheep, that ſtraggles from the fold, it ſhall meet with a Crook, happily with the bite of a dog. It may be God may catch you with his hook, happily you ſhall be bitten with a Temptation, and bitten with deſertion, if you ſtraggle from his fold; but the more you keep in communion with God, the more likely you are to keep in your comforts; walking with God is the very fewel that kindles the fire of comfort in a Chriſtians breſt, that keeps comfort alive. The more
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115140:71"/>you flag in your communion, the more ſhall you flag in your aſſurance, and the more ſhall your comforts die. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with your God, it hath two particulars in it. Firſt, in keeping you free from ſinne, <hi>Job</hi> 11.14, 15. Secondly, in keeping in the exerciſe of grace, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 32.17. Now, the more you keep out ſinne, the more you keep in comforts; the more you increaſe in grace, the more you increaſe in comforts. Grace and comfort, they one promote another; Grace promotes comfort, and comfort heightens you in the increaſe of grace: Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> in his ſalutations puts them both together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. And thus having finiſhed this Query, there is onely one more, which (God willing) I ſhall diſpatch at this time; And that is</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Wherein appeares the difference between that man that hath aſſurance of his effectual calling upon good ground, and between thoſe men that onely have preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſwaſions of their effectual calling, when they are not? Beloved, this queſtion is worthy the diſcuſſion; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it, I ſhall lay down 9 or 10 differences; As</p>
               <p>Firſt, That man that hath ſound and true aſſurance of his effectual calling, he is very careful to take heed of ſinne, that ſo he might not eclipſe his comforts, or loſe his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. He is careful (I ſay) to free his heart from ſin as much as may be, as conſidering, that though he cannot ſinne away his ſoule, he may ſinne away his comforts; though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſinne away his ſalvation, he may ſinne away his conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. A man that hath this aſſurance, he knowes the worth of aſſurance, and he knowes how ſoon it is loſt, and how hardly it is gained; and that makes him very tender of ſin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having theſe Promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves.</hi> When a godly man knowes that God is his God, (For that's the Promiſe ſpoken of in the verſe before) knowing that he belongs to God, and the Promiſes belong to him; he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, it makes him cleanſe himſelfe from all filthineſſe, both of fleſh and ſpirit; that he keep no ſinne in the ſpirit, nor no ſin in the body. A man that hath aſſurance, it makes him very tender of every ſinne: But now, a man that hath
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115140:72"/>preſumptuous perſwaſions of his own goodneſſe, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions will make him more bold, and more venturo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kedneſſe day after day; he is bold and venturous upon every ſin. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.4.5. <hi>Thou haſt cried to me, My Father, my Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r, thou art the guide of my youth; with thou reſerve anger for ever, and ſhall there be no end of thy indignation?</hi> Yet what ſaith God? <hi>Yet thou didſt evill as much as thou couldſt.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, You cry, My Father; you perſwade your ſelves God is your Father, and yet you will ſpeak and do evil as much as you can: Here God brands them for a preſumptuous people. To perſwade your ſelves that God is your Father, and yet to do wickedneſſe as much as you can, and to be drunk as often as you can, and ſwear as oft as you can; alas you deceive your own hearts in this: for God cannot be your Father in this ſenſe. And Beloved, I beſeech you in my going over theſe heads, that you would lay them to your own hearts, and ſee if you may be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe preſumptuous perſwaſions, that goe over the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a man that hath reall aſſurance of his effectual calling, that man meets with more aſſaults and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the devil to annoy him in his peace, then other men do that have only a counterfeit aſſurance. As you know thoſe ſhops that have the beſt wares, and richeſt Treaſures, Gold-ſmiths ſhops, they are moſt expoſed to Robbery; when men will not meddle with a petty ſtall. Thoſe ſhips that are moſt richly laden, they are in moſt danger to meet with Pirats at ſea, when your ſmaller barks laden with goods of leſſer value ſcape-free: It is ſo with Chriſtians. Thoſe Chriſtians, that are moſt richly laden with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of aſſurance, that have in their hearts this precious jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, they are in moſt danger of the devils Temptations, to be as a Pirat or Robber, by force to ſet upon them, to annoy them. It is thoſe that have moſt aſſurance, that the devil doth envy moſt, that he will never let them alone, but hunts
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115140:72"/>them as a Partridge over the Mountaines by dejections, and by ſuggeſtions, and by variety of Temptations, Satans fierieſt darts; and by diſtruſt, and by injected ſcruples, and by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of carnal reaſonings, and by conſulting with fleſh and blood, and for want of comfortable feelings; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will be ſtill putting them on, to ſee if he can damp their comforts, and make them <hi>caſt away their confidence, which hath a great recompence of reward.</hi> Hence it is the Apoſtle preſſeth that Chriſtians ſhould not caſt away their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, (a Metaphor ſome think drawn from a ſhip at Sea;
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.35.</note> Merchants, when they are at Sea, when their ſhip by a ſtorm and tempeſt is toſt upon the billows, and likely to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſhipwrack, being heavy laden, they will caſt away their wares, to ſave their lives. Now ſome, in Alluſion to this, think that the devil ſo toſſeth a poor ſoul in point of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as a ſhip is toſſed upon the Sea by the winde. Now if you are toſſed upon the Sea of Temptation, and upon the waves of Trouble and Aſſaults, do not caſt away your wares, do not throw away your comforts,) which implies, that godly men are often ſet upon, and often aſſaulted; that though the devil cannot bring you to hell, he would fain have you to have a hell in your conſciences while you live; he doth not only envy your happineſſe, but comforts alſo: Whereas on the contrary, men that harbour perſwaſions they are called, when they are not; the devil Iulls them aſleep, he lets them alone, and never troubles them. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. <hi>When the strong man poſſeſſeth the houſe, the goods are at peace:</hi> That is, when the devil of hell hath whole poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul of a man, he is no whit tempted, his thoughts are at quiet. When the devil ſees a man build upon a ſandy and corrupt foundation, he will never ſhake that by a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation leſt you ſhould by ſhaking be a wakened to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>a better and more induring ſubſtance.</hi> When the devil ſees you Iull'd aſleep in a golden dream of preſumption, he will never awaken you by Temptation, but I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts you ſleep on, becauſe he knowes that ſleep will be a ſleep to death. As a man lying aſleep on a ſteep rock, dreams merrily of Crowns
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115140:73"/>and Kingdoms, but ſuddenly ſtarting for joy, breake his neck, and tumbles into the bottom of the Sea; ſo is it with a man that harbours ungrounded perſwaſions of his good eſtate. That which a carnal man makes his evidence, that he is in a good condition, is an undoubted demonſtration he is in a bad. You ſhall have a wicked man, when he hears a godly man to be troubled in minde and wounded in ſpirit, he will tell you, he thanks God, he was never troubled ſince he was born, the devil never diſturbed him, and he hath had a ſtrong faith ever ſince he can remember. Alas, Beloved, this is a ſad ſigne; thou makeſt this a ſign of thy comfort, whereas indeed it is a demonſtration of thy want of a ſound aſſurance; for were thy aſſurance good, the Devil would never let thee alone, but would ſtill be labouring to make thee caſt away thy confidence; but being bad, he would have thee nouriſh it ſtill. We ſay, thoſe Oxen that are fed in greeneſt paſtures, they are neareſt the ſlaughter; when the poor lean Oxe that hath the yoke and whip every day, and is at daily labour, is long liv'd, and in a better condition. Thoſe men that the devill lets alone, and never tempts, that are as fatted oxen, never come under the whip and yoke, and never are troubled; it is an argument, they are near the ſlaughter, and under a great deal of danger of their ſouls: but thoſe that are under the yoke, that are often tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the pricks of Sathan lie upon them; this is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, their comforts are right, and their evidence good, becauſe ſo aſſaulted and oppoſed by the devil.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, true aſſurance is more or leſſe in a mans ſpirit, by how much more or leſſe that man keeps in communion with God. If a man doth rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t in his converſe with God, and grow careleſſe and formal, and a ſtranger to God, he ſhall grow a ſtranger to himſelfe in the end, and to his comforts alſo: but if a man keep cloſe to God, and keep cloſe to duties, can retire and recollect himſelf to converſe with God in a more ſolemn and ſerious manner, is preparedly and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exerciſed in Ordinances, can poure out his ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods boſome; that man is in the way to have his comforts
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115140:73"/>raiſed up. Whereas now for men that have falſe comforts and perſwaſions, whether they are much or little with God, all is one to them, their comforts are at the ſame ſtand ſtill. Come to a man that hath falſe comforts, and at all times he is alike peremptory, he is in the ſame perſwaſion he was 3.4.7. yeares ago. Ask him any week in the yeer, any day in the week, any hour in the day, and he will tell you, he hath the ſame comforts, and the ſame evidences ſtill: he had a ſtrong faith in God, and he hath it ſtill; he had ſtrong hopes to be ſaved, and ſo he hath ſtill; he is ſtill pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory in his comforts, though he never ſo much alter in communion with his God: this is an argument thy perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are ſalſe, becauſe a Chriſtians communion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God doth feed his comforts. Now as the body, by how the much more or leſſe it is fed, by ſo much the more it is weakened or ſtrengthened: ſo it is with your comforts; ſo much as they are cheriſhed by your walking with God, ſo much they grow weak or ſtrong. Now let a wicked man grow never ſo vile, and never ſo ſinful, it interrupts not his peace; he hath hopes and aſſurance ſtill, and he will truſt in God ſtill, though he ſin ever; this is an argument, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are unſound. You have a lively picture of this, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.11. <hi>The heads of the people judge forreward, the Prieſts teach for hire, and the Prophets divine for mony: and yet they will lean upon the Lord; and ſay, Is not the Lord among us?</hi> That is, though they have theſe ſins among them, and did walk thus and thus; yet they would hope in God to be ſaved for all this. Why, Beloved, thou wilt find God to fail thee; though he never faild an aſſured Chriſtian, yet he will fail that man that leanes upon him, when he belongs not to him. When thou doſt intermit walking with God, and doſt lanch forth into a gulph and ſea of luſts, and yet canſt ſtill ſay, thou art the ſame in thy comforts, and the ſame in thy perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; it is an argument all thy comforts are but falſe, and thy evidence unſound.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Reall aſſurance of your eſtate, it doth bear up the ſoul under the greateſt outward ſorrow and ſufferings
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115140:74"/>that it can meet with in this world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>They ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, knowing in themſelves that they had in heaven a better and more induring ſubſtance.</hi> What made them ſo to rejoyce to ſee their houſes plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before them, their eſtates taken from them, but this, they knew in their own ſelves, and had aſſurance in their own hearts that Chriſt was theirs, and heaven was theirs? and this made them ſuffer joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.50. <hi>This is my comfort in affliction, that thy word doth quicken me;</hi> That is, this beares up my heart, when I am afflicted, that I have a Word to build upon, that I have aſſurance, I have intereſt in a Promiſe to build upon; this quickens and bears me up under my ſorrowes. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.81. <hi>My ſpirit had fainted within me, onely that I hoped in thy Word.</hi> That is, I had hope and confidence built upon thy Word, and that kept me from feares, and fainting, and diſcouragement under my affliction.
<note place="margin">The ſenſe of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of their ſin ſhall take away the ſenſe of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 33.24. <hi>The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſick; the people that dwell therein, ſhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> Beloved, Aſſurance will lift up and bear up the heart under all ſorrows. Aſſurance in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is like oile. Now poure oile into a ſea or ocean of water, and the oile will never be kept under, but ſtill be uppermoſt; ſo this oile of comfort, and this oile of aſſurance, it will bear thee up on the top, though thou ſhouldſt be caſt into a flood of troubles, and an ocean of ſorrowes. I have read in <hi>Latimers</hi> witings a notable ſaying of his to <hi>Ridley</hi> that famous Marty. Sometime, ſaith he, when I live in a ſetled and ſtedfaſt aſſurance about the ſtate of my ſoul, me thinks then I am as bold as a Lion, I can laugh at all trouble, no affliction daunts me; but when I am eclipſed in my comforts, I am of ſo fearfu a ſpirit, that I could run into a very mouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole. Beloved, it is ſo with godly men, when they want aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of their eſtate, and the ſoundneſſe of their call, every affliction daunts, and every trouble ſtartles them. O but when they can live in a ſetled aſſurance of their intereſt in Chriſt, and calling by him; they are as bold as Lions, and they are born up with comfort, under all the ſorrowes and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115140:74"/>ſufferings they meet withall. But now men that have falſe perſwaſions, their perſwaſions can never bear up the heart under a trouble, and at a loſſe, and at a pinch; becauſe it is not a ſaving and inward comfort, it can never create inward peace. The comforts of wicked men when they come to ſuffer, they are like cloth that is ill woven. Cloth that is well made, let a man be in a ſhowre of rain, it will never ſhrink; but ill woven cloth, let it be but in a ſhowre, it ſhrinkes preſently: It is ſo with mens comforts; Bring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts well wrought into a ſhowre of trouble, and that man will not ſhrink under his trouble; but bring an ill wrought and unſound aſſurance, and that will ſhrink and fail, and pull in, and will not bear up the heart under the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and ſufferings he may meet withall. Preſuming <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton,</hi> that boaſted his fat fleſh ſhould fry in the fire before he would forſake his Religion; when he came to the trial, flagged preſently.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Sound aſſurance, whereever it is, it makes the heart more humble towards God and man, and more vile in its own eyes. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. There you have this Character: <hi>I live,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, by the faith of the Sonne of God; and Chriſt hath loved me, and given himſelfe for me.</hi> Here is his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: what then? Doth this lift up <hi>Paul?</hi> NO, it makes him marvel; <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me; Paul</hi> recollects himſelf, I live, no; it is not I that live, but Chriſt that liveth in me. See how <hi>Paul</hi> was beaten off from a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious pride and exaltation of ſpirit in himſelfe. It is not I that live. The thoughts of his comforts made him recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect himſelfe, and ſeeme vile in his own eyes: Whereas (alas) falſe perſwaſions puffe up the ſoule with pride, and make a man ſupercilious, and high conceited, crying out as <hi>Jehu</hi> did, <hi>Jonadab, is thy heart like mine? Come ſee my zeal for the Lord;</hi> they make him proud like <hi>Jehu</hi> in his falſe perſwaſions.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Sound comforts, and real aſſurance do engage the ſoul to walk before God in a courſe of holineſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Thy loving kindneſſe is before mine eyes;</hi> that is, I am
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115140:75"/>aſſured, as if I ſaw the thing with mine eye, that Gods loving kindneſſe is towards me. What then? <hi>and I will walk in thy truth.</hi> I will walk before thee with a holy and ſincere heart; and <hi>I will not haunt with vain perſons,</hi> verſe 4. And <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocency,</hi> verſe 6, &amp;c. ſo that you ſee <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> would walk in a courſe of holineſſe, becauſe he had an evidence, and aſſurance of Gods love to him So 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>He that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as Chriſt is pure;</hi> that is, that man that doth nouriſh hopes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of heaven, his hopes will make him a Chriſtian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring to purifie his own heart, and to be holy as Chriſt is holy. This is the nature of true aſſurance. But now for falſe aſſurance, the man that hath it, doth not look after holineſſe at all; he thinks himſelfe well enough, that he hath attained that which every wiſe man ſhould reſt in,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Si dixeris ſufficit peruſti. Aug. de verb. Apoſt. Serm.</hi> 18.</note> without medling any further; nay, he is ſo far from laying bonds upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to walk in a courſe of holineſſe, that he will rather take incouragement from thence to walk in a way of looſeneſſe and profaneneſſe: Becauſe grace abounds, he will abound in ſin; this is the ill uſe that falſe comfort makes of Gods grace. And therefore, Beloved, look over your hearts. Do the comforts you pretend to have, and the aſſurance you pretend to enjoy, make you more to purſue holineſſe? that you can ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I ſee thy loving kindneſſe is before me,</hi> and therefore <hi>I will love thy wayes, and hate ſinfulneſſe;</hi> or can you ſay, you have comforts, therefore you will run into ſin, and wallow in wickednes? this is an argument thy comforts are not true.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, True aſſurance, it is got and kept with a great deal of diligence and induſtry. Your beſt things are hardeſt to get, and hardeſt to keep. Stones are to be had in every place; but gold, you muſt dig deep, and take paines to dive into the bowels of the earth, before you can get that. Weeds grow eaſily, but your fine garden-flowers, they muſt be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en watered, and carefully looked unto, or elſe they will not grow: Beloved, this weed of falſe perſwaſion and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it is a weed that will grow under every hedge, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115140:75"/>thrive in every Garden without looking after; whereas alas, the flower of true comforts and ſaving aſſurance, it is hard to make it grow; and when it is growne, it is hard to keep it from withering and blaſting. Aſſurance it coſts a man the waiting many a year, the ſhedding many a teare, the making of many a prayer, before he can get or keep it; whereas alas, falſe aſſurance it is eaſily gotten, and eaſily kept. A man may get preſumption without any paines at all; the devil will egge you on both to get and keep it: Therefore you that eaſily get your comforts without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and keep your comforts without paines, you may be ſure your comforts are but falſe.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, True aſſurance it is got by the Word, and grounded upon the Word. It is got by the Word, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57.19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace, to them that are nigh, and to them that are afarre of.</hi> The fruit of the Lips, that is, the fruit of the Miniſters preaching; the Word which falls from the Lips of a godly Miniſter: God hath ordained and created that to be the way to work and create peace, peace; that is a ſound peace in the hearts of his people. And it is not onely got, but it is bottomed upon the Word alſo. It is the Word and ſomewhat in the Word, that beares up the hearts of the people of God, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 119.49. <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord, wherein thou haſt cauſed thy ſervant to hope.</hi> So verſe 50, 51. It is the Word of God that bottomes the comforts of the people of God; whereas look now upon wicked men, and they neither got their comfors by the Word, nor do they ground them upon the Word; but firſt, they have had ſtrong hopes in God ever ſince they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; and ſecondly, they keep and ground them either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their good meaning, that they mean well towards God, or elſe thirdly, they ground them upon this, that they are not ſo bad as other men are. A poor weak ground. The Phariſee could ſay ſo; <hi>I am no extortioner, no drunkard, no adulterer, and the like:</hi> yet never came to heaven for all this. Or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſe fourthly, they ground their comforts on this, becauſe they receive from God abundance of outward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115140:76"/>you finde was their ground of preſumption, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Ephraim ſaid, I am become rich, and I have found me out ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; in all my labour they ſhall finde no iniquity in me, that is, ſinne. Ephraim</hi> would ſay, I am become rich, and have got me an eſtate, and now I am an honeſt man, and they ſhall finde no ſinne in me: yet this was a meer preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe God tells us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1. <hi>No man knowes either love or hatred by the things that are before him.</hi> And <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, God gives men riches to their hurt;</hi> And therefore this can be no evidence of a grounded aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, That man that hath a good aſſurance, he is willing to be tried either by God or man, touching the truth of his aſſurance. This you finde, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.2, 3. <hi>Try me, O Lord, examine me, prove me, and try my reines, and my heart, for thy loving kindeneſſe is before me.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay. Lord, I make a profeſſion, that I have thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in mine eye, that I am aſſured thou loveſt me; Lord, I put my ſoul upon the Trial: Do thou try me, if my heart be not right in my aſſurance. And not by God onely, but they are willing to be tried by man alſo. And therefore you have that phraſe of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. that <hi>when men ask you an account of the hope that is in you, you ſhould be ready to give anſwer;</hi> that is, when men ask you what hopes you have of heaven, and upon what ground do you hope to be ſaved? the Apoſtle ſaith, you ſhould be ready to give anſwer of that hope that is in you. And who were they that ſhould do ſo? they were thoſe that <hi>had a good conſcience,</hi> thoſe men that had conſciences free from ſin, and had evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their own conſciences, that they belonged to God, they were ready, whoever asked them, to give a reaſon why they hoped for heaven. Whereas a man that hath falſe perſwaſions of heaven and of his effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that man cannot endure to be tried either by God or man. He is like the man that hath ſtolne goods in his houſe. A man that is an honeſt man, let the Conſtable come, let ſearch be made, it never troubles him, becauſe they are his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115140:76"/>own goods that be hath bought by his own mony: but the Thief, when the Conſtable comes, and ſearch is made, every Trunk that is opened, his heart trembles: It is ſo with an unſound-hearted man; a man that hath falſe aſſurance, he is afraid to be ſearched in point of his aſſurance, leſt there ſhould be a flaw found in it. Come to a man that hath falſe perſwaſions, (as to your Formaliſts, and thoſe that are preſumptuous to wretches) come to theſe men, and put this queſtion unto them, Upon what ground do you hope for ſalvation.? What evidence can you give of your effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al calling? How can you make out upon Scripture-grounds, that you ſhall go to heaven? Such queſtions as theſe will puzzle an unſound heart, that he cannot give you any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable anſwer at all. And herein the difference is palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble between a grounded aſſurance and theſe falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions that wicked men have.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, True aſſurance, whereever it is, it makes a man ſo to value the comforts of the Spirit of God, that he doth undervalue all other comforts in the world in compariſon of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon me;</hi> what then? <hi>and this ſhall more glad my heart, then when my corn and wine and oile increaſeth.</hi> Beloved, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it doth ſo tranſport and raiſe up the heart, that it makes all things in the world, all comforts here below to be nothing in compariſon of that. The favour of Princes is nothing to that man that hath the favour of God; Life, and all the comforts of life, are nothing to that man that hath comfort in reference to his eternal life; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindneſſe, O Lord, is better then life. David</hi> did not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue his life, nor all the comforts of it, ſo as he valued the loving kindneſſe of his God. But now, a man that hath falſe perſwaſions, theſe do not ſo tranſport his ſpirit, and take up the whole man, and fill the ſoul <hi>with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory;</hi> theſe do no whit abate his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in the world. A man you know that hath taſted hony, other things are of an unpleaſant taſte to him that are eaten after: Beloved, aſſurance it is like hony; nothing ſo ſweet to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115140:77"/>godly palate, as that is Now when a godly perſon taſtes of the hony of aſſurance, all other outward comforts, they are but as gall and wormwood, things unpleaſant to his taſte and palate. And thus you ſee I have laid down ten particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to you. I would intreat you to diſtinguiſh in your own hearts, whether you are the people that have a true aſſurance, or onely falſe perſwaſions of your effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And let me tell you, the reaſon why I ſpeak of this, is, becauſe the moſt of men in the world do miſſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by falſe perſwaſions. Where deſperation damnes one ſoul, preſumption damns a thouſand. I might ſay of this, as it was ſung in the Triumphant ſong of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul, Saul hath ſlain his thouſands, but David his ten thouſands:</hi> So I might ſay, deſperation hath ſlain a thouſand, but preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ten thouſand. Thouſands and ten thouſands are ſlain and undone for ever, by harbouring preſumptuous and groundleſſe perſwaſions of their effectual calling, when they are not.</p>

Secondly, to them that have ſometime enjoyed this aſſurance, but now have loſt or eclipſed the comfortable feeling of their aſſurance. Into theſe two heads I ſhall branch my diſcourſe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> And firſt, the exhortation or counſel I am to give, is to them that are aſſured of their effectual calling; that have done the work the Apoſtle here injoynes them; that <hi>have made ſure their vocation,</hi> and by unqueſtionable evidence can ſay ſo. And theſe I would adviſe to three particular duties.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you ſhould be directed rightly to uſe your aſſurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:115140:78"/>Secondly, Carefully to preſerve your aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Daily to improve your aſſurance. This is the threefold task that lies upon you, that enjoy this rich jewel of aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, You are to take care, that you rightly uſe and manage your aſſurance. A thing hardly gotten, if it be not well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, a man may enjoy it in a way of loſſe to himſelfe. To uſe aſſurance well is the great Art of a Chriſtian. And here (that I might ſpeak diſtinctly to this direction) I ſhall lay down eight particulars, as concomitants, or gracious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which muſt accompany you in a condition of aſſurance; As</p>
               <p>Firſt, You muſt uſe and manage your aſſurance with humility, in caſe you uſe it well. Aſsured Chriſtians muſt be humble Chriſtians. The more high you are in comforts, the more low you ſhould be in Spirit. You know the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt eares of corn hang down their head loweſt, when light and flaſhy darnel that hath nothing of worth in it, lifts up its head on high. Aſſured Chriſtians, they are like your full and ripe eares of corn; the more full they are of this fruit of the Spirit, aſſurance, the more low do they, and ſhould they hang down their heads. It is your empty bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels make a noiſe, when your full veſſels though you ſtrike them, will not ſound: It is thoſe Chriſtians that are moſt empty of faith, and moſt empty of aſsurance, that make moſt noiſe, and are moſt proud of their gifts and graces; when your aſſured Chriſtians they are like veſsels full of the beſt liquor; that makethe leaſt noiſe. The fuller God hath fil'd you with this comfort, the more you ſhould ſhine forth in humility. As <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt loved him, and gave himſelfe for him;</hi> when he was moſt full of comforts, he was moſt fill'd with humility, and ſaid, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, You muſt manage your aſsurance with a high valuation of the comforts of God in you. A man that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a benefit, if he do not value it, it is a provocation to the man that gave it, either to repent of his gift, or take it
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115140:78"/>away. <hi>David</hi> when he had aſsurance, mark how he values it: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindneſſe is better then life.</hi> He va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued the comforts of his God, and the ſhining of Gods countenance better then life. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me, and that ſhall more glad me, then when my corn and wine and oile increaſeth. David</hi> would more value the comforts of Gods Spirit, then any other comfort in the world. Aſsured Chriſtians, that uſe aſsurance rightly, they muſt put a high valuation and worth upon it. And the reaſon is, Becauſe you will not then eaſily part with your aſsurance for a baſe and beggerly luſt, and for a fruitleſse ſinne, if once you know the value and worth of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Your aſsurance muſt make you to live with a weaned heart from the comforts of this world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. the laſt verſe, compared with Chapt. 5.1. The Apoſtle tels you, <hi>We doe not look after the things that are ſeen, that are temporal.</hi> What made the Apoſtle not to look after world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things? he gives the reaſon, <hi>For when this houſe of ours is diſſolved, we have a dwelling with God, eternal in the heavens.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, That's the reaſon we do not look after the world, as worldly men do; for we know that when we leave this world, we have a heaven to go to. The aſsurance of the Bleſsednes of their future being, did make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the world, as a thing not worthy the glance of the eye; Perſons that have aſsurance, can ſay as <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.8. <hi>Shew us,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philip, the Father, and it ſufficeth us.</hi> Thus ſaith a gracious heart, O ſweet Jeſus, ſhew us but thy favour; aſsure but my ſoule, that thy Father is a reconciled Father to me in thy ſelfe, that he is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as well as thy Father; Shew me but the Father, and it ſufficeth me; though I have little or nothing in the world, this ſhall ſuffice me. Gracious hearts, that live in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of aſsurance, they ought to live with a weaned heart from the comforts of this world. Men that have taſted hony or ſome other ſweet morſel, they do diſtaſte all other things, though of themſelves very pleaſant: So men that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115140:79"/>have taſted of this hony of Gods love, and the ſweetneſſe of this grace of aſſurance; it will make them diſtaſte and diſreliſh all the things of this world, though of themſelves pleaſant &amp; good. If a man look on the Sun it dazles his eyes, that he cannot diſcern colours about him; ſo he that beholds the light of Gods countenance, will not look upon the things here below. I may allude to that place, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.39. <hi>No man,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>having drunk old wine, ſtraight way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth new; for he ſaith, The old is better.</hi> His meaning is this, No man that hath had a taſte of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; hath had communion and fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, and lain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Miniſtery of Jeſus Chriſt; no man that hath drunk of this old wine, will ſay, new is better; to have other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and other pleaſures, is better; no man will ſay this, ſaith Chriſt. And ſo he compares his Miniſtery, and his doctrine, and the comfort Gods people have thereby, to old wine: Beloved, ſo I ſay, men that have drunk draughts of this wine of conſolation, and men that are ſet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>edly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and have had a <hi>taſte that the Lord is gracious,</hi> no man will now ſay, that the world is better, and the comforts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low better. No, the aſsurance of Gods love ſhould wean a mans heart from all the comforts of the world. As old <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, when he ſaw his ſonne <hi>Joſeph</hi> in his old age, after he had made many a prayer, and ſhed many a tear; <hi>O Joſeph my ſonne is yet alive, I have enough.</hi> As was the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the ſame ſhould be the carriage of a Chriſtian towards Chriſt. If he can ſay, My <hi>Joſeph,</hi> my Jeſus is alive in my heart; I having him, have enough; this comfort ſhould raviſh his ſpirit. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was rapt up into the third heaven, was ſo tranſported that he knew not whether he was in the body or no; ſo are the people of God raviſhed with heavenly conſolations, that they minde not theſe earthly things.

                     </gap>eſcere mundum.</note> It is a ſpeech that <hi>Bernard</hi> hath, That to whomſoever Jeſus Chriſt once becomes ſweet, that he can taſte the ſweetneſſe of his love, and the ſweetneſs of his mercy, this very ſweetneſſe in Chriſts love will imbitter the world unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:115140:79"/>Fourthly, you are to manage and uſe your aſsurance with tenderneſs of conſcience againſt ſinne. Aſsured Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould be tender-conſcienced Chriſtians. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>God will ſpeak peace to his people;</hi> but mark the duty: <hi>they muſt not turn again unto folly.</hi> They muſt not run again into ſinne, they muſt be tender of ſin, and then God will ſpeak peace to his people. Sin (as I once told you) will be like wind in the bowels of the earth. Philoſophers ſay, Earthquakes and ruptures are occaſioned by winde got into the bowels and cavernes of the earth, which having no place for vent, it overturnes mountaines and buildings: Beloved, ſinne in the heart will do the like; it will make the heart quake and tremble if it be there; it will prove the grave of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and the reſurrection of thy feares. Therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that are aſsured, they muſt take heed of ſinne; if they would keep their comforts, they muſt keep their hearts that ſin get not into their conſciences. Beloved, they that are aſſured Chriſtians, they know how difficultly they did attain this aſſurance, and they know how ſweetly they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy this aſſurance, and that will make them very tender, that they do not loſe a thing ſo hardly gotten and ſweetly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed for a trivial luſt; that they loſe not their former evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and revive former terrors.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Aſſurance muſt be managed with patience in bearing any outward affliction that you may meet with in the world. Aſſured Chriſtians muſt be patient Chriſtians, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>They ſuffered joyfully the ſpoyling of their goods, knowing that they had in heaven a better and more enduring ſubſtance;</hi> and that made the Saints of God tuſh and ſcorn at all the loſſes they met with in the world. Suppoſe a man be at Sea, and have precious jewels and pearles aboard with him; if the man can be but ſure he ſhall ſave his own life, and ſave his jewels, though he loſe the Casket, though he loſe the box, that will not much trouble him: Thou that art ſure of heaven, thou canſt never loſe that pearle, thy ſoul; thou maiſt loſe the ſhell, thy life; thou maiſt loſe the Casket, thou ſhalt never loſe the jewel; and ſhall that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115140:80"/>thee? If thou art an aſſured Chriſtian, be ſure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtorme of Temptation blow upon thee, thou ſhalt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſe the box, never loſe the pearle. This therefore ſhould make aſſured Chriſtians to be patient Chriſtians, what ever they ſhall undergo here in the world. I have read a ſtory in <hi>Fox</hi> his Acts and Monuments, of a woman, who when ſhe came to be tried for her Religion before <hi>Bonner,</hi> that bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Biſhop; he threatened her, he would take away her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band from her; ſaith ſhe, Chriſt is my husband; I will take away thy childe: Chriſt, ſaith ſhe, is better to me then ten ſonnes; I will ſtrip thee, ſaith he, of all thy outward comforts: yea but Chriſt is mine, and you cannot ſtrip me of him, ſaith ſhe. The thoughts of this bore up the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans heart; ſpoile her of all, and take away all, yet Chriſt was hers, and they could not take him away. O Beloved, when thy ſoul lives in the aſſurance of Gods love, and of thy calling to grace and glory; this ſhould make you wonderful patient to endure what ever you ſhall meet with here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. It was the ſpeech of that famous ſervant of God, holy <hi>Bradford,</hi> when a company of his fellow priſoners were that morning to go to be burnt, ſaith <hi>Bradford,</hi> O my fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferers, be chearful, for though we are all of us to have a bitter breakfaſt, yet truly we ſhall have a chearful dinner. Here you ſee how aſſured Chriſtians, their comforts in God did ſo tranſport their hearts, that it made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look, and with patience bear all afflictions they were to meet with. You have a remarkable phraſe, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 33.24. <hi>The Inhabitants of Sion ſhall not ſay, I am ſick, the people that dwell therein, ſhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> A ſtrange paſsage; he doth not ſay, they were not ſick, but the text ſaith, they ſhould not ſay ſo. And what's the reaſon? why ſhould the people forget their ſorrows, &amp; forget their pains? this ſhould make them; the Lord had forgiven them their iniquities. The ſenſe of pardon took away the ſenſe of pain. And Beloved, Chriſtians ſhould walk thus to ſhew that trouble ſhould not daunt them, and afflictions never ſtartle them; you that are aſsured Chriſtians, you ſhould be patient
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115140:80"/>Chriſtians under all ſufferings. And take this for a rule, that God takes impatience more unkindly at aſsured Chriſtians hands, then at the hands of any men in the world beſides: Becauſe if God give thee aſsurance, he hath given thee a ſeal in thy own breſt, that all ſhall work for thy good; and wilt thou be impatient? He hath given thee a ſeal in thy own breſt, that heaven ſhall make amends for all; and wilt thou be angry? God will take this more unkindly at them then any.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Aſsurance ſhould be managed with indeared love to Jeſus Chriſt. Aſsured Chriſtians ſhould be Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loving Chriſtians. When Chriſt told <hi>Mary Magdalen, Thy ſins which are many are forgiven thee,</hi> When ſhe had aſsurance, her ſinnes were pardoned, what ſaith Chriſt? <hi>Much was forgiven her, therefore ſhe loved much:</hi> becauſe ſhe was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble much was forgiven her, ſhe would ſhew forth much love to Jeſus Chriſt. And the reaſon is, becauſe it was Chriſts love brought thoſe Chriſtians into a State of ſalvation, and his love likewiſe that gave them aſsurance of their own call, and this ſhould indear their hearts to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Aſsurance ſhould be managed with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of compaſſion towards thoſe Chriſtians that are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted &amp; troubled by Satan. Aſsured Chriſtians ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Chriſtians. If God have given you aſsurance of his love, you ſhould carry compaſſionate breſts towards your Brethren, who remain behinde in great diſtreſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, that lie toſsed and turmoiled by Temptations. When a ſhip is brought ſafe to the haven, if they have any bowels, when they ſee another ſhip in the main Ocean ſtrugling for life in the midſt of the waters, they will pity them: You that have got aſsurance, you are come to a ſafe harbour; but your tempted Brethren, they are toſsed upon the waves and tempeſts of temptation, you ſhould now have compaſſionate hearts towards tempted Chriſtians. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>The Lord hath comforted us in all our tribulation, that we might comfort others with the ſame comforts, wherewith we our ſelves are comforted of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115140:81"/>God.</hi> It was the work and task of the Apoſtle, and them with him, that they having comforts and aſſurance from God, they would labour to comfort others, and bear up others, and eſtabliſh others, that they might rejoyce, and receive the ſame comforts with themſelves. Hence you read, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>Be pitiful, be compaſſionate to your Brethren, love as Brethren.</hi> Now upon what ground doth the Apoſtle preſſe this compaſſion. Read verſe 9. <hi>Knowing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that you are hereunto called, that you ſhould inherit a bleſſing.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, upon this ground I woo you to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate becauſe you are called to inherit a bleſſing; that is, you know and are aſſured, that you are a bleſſed people, and you ſhall be a ſaved people, therefore have compaſſion on your brethren, who are tempted and troubled, that you might bring them to the ſame pitch of comfort you are brought to.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Aſſurance ſhould be managed with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart: Aſſured Chriſtians ſhould be chearful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. We read <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.1, 2. That <hi>Nehemiah</hi> all the while he was before the face of the King, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the King, the Text ſaith, <hi>Nehemiah for a long time was not ſad:</hi> the Kings preſence did ſo cheare up <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> heart. Now to this I would allude: If the preſence and face of King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> did make <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that for a long time he was not ſad before him; Oh how much more ſhould the face of God, and the preſence of God in a mans ſoul, and the favour of God towards a man, how much more ſhould this keep thee from being ſad in Gods preſence, from a lumpiſh and Melancholy and ſad ſpirit? Thou art in the preſence of a King, in the favour of God, and this ſhould keep thee from being ſad and heavy. None in the world have greater grounds of joy then thoſe that live in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant aſſurance of the love of God towards them. It is for condemned men, that are condemned to the Gallows, to hang down their heads and wring their hands; but let the pardoned people of the Lord rejoyce. The man that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, he hangs down his head, but the man that comes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115140:81"/>pardoned from the barre, with what a chearful countenance will that man come? you are all a people pardoned by your God, you may well be a rejoycing people: I remember a paſſage I have read in D. <hi>Halls</hi> Works, in his Meditations upon the Creatures, ſpeaking of a little Bird called Robbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red-breſt, that when he was in his ſtudy, came chirping at the window, and leaping upon his book, and ſinging a great while together; upon this ſight he breaks out into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. O this little ſilly Bird, that doth not know where to pick up the next crum, that doth not know where to pitch and reſt it ſelfe for the next night, yet behold, how chearfully doth this Bird ſing, when man, and a Chriſtian man that knows God to be his Father, that hath not only crumbs of ourward bleſſings but whole morſels of inward comfort, and can drink draughts of inward conſolation: Chriſtians, that have a God, and a heaven, that have Chriſt and glory, yet they cannot be merry, as a poor Bird can be: and truly it is a good Meditation: Many times people that are called by Jeſus Chriſt, and have ground and aſſurance of their everlaſting happineſſe by him, yet they cannot be ſo merry as a poor Bird will be; Birds in the morning will be chirp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſinging, as if nothing lay at the heart, when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is ſad, and vexing, and wearying out his life in diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and ſorrowes; this becomes not a Chriſtian. Aſſured Chriſtians they ſhould be chearful Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Aſſured Chriſtians they ſhould be thankful Chriſtians. For one to give a man a promiſe, it is worth thanks, but when a man ſhall not onely give, but aſſure that Promiſe, that he will make it good; that is more thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. Beloved, if God had only promiſed you a heaven, and had given no aſſurance, it was thanks-worthy, but when God ſhall give thee his Broad Seal, that ſhall ſeal thee up to the day of Redemption, and when God ſhall give thee an aſſurance in thy own breſt, thou ſhalt go to heaven, and go to God, this ſhould much more make thee in thy Spirit bleſſe thy God. It is a ſpeech of the Prophet <hi>David, My ſoule, bleſſe thou the Lord for his marvellous loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:115140:82"/>Thou haſt kindneſſe, and thou haſt marvellous loving kindneſſe; My ſoul bleſſe God for this. <hi>David</hi> would not keep back Gods praiſes, ſeeing God would not keep back Davids comforts. In heaven we ſhall break forth into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, becauſe we have good things in poſſeſſion; here we ſhould break forth into thankſgiving, becauſe we have them in expectation. And thus I have done with the firſt part of my direction to you that are aſſured Chriſtians, you ſhould labour firſt rightly to uſe your aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All you that are aſſured Chriſtians, you are to be directed carefully to keep and preſerve your aſſurance. There is no leſſe skill, ſaith the Poet, to be put forth in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue,
<note place="margin">Non minor eſt virtus quàm quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere parta tueri.</note> then in getting of it. It is ſaid of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he was a skilful ſouldier to get victories, but he had no skill to keep them, when gotten; It may be ſaid ſo of us, Chriſtians can get aſſurance, but they have not the skill to keep it, when they have got it. This therefore I am now to preſs, that you would be careful to preſerve your aſſurance. And here in ſpeaking of this, I ſhall lay down two particulars; that in caſe you would keep your aſſurance, there are ſome things you muſt do; and ſome things you muſt avoid and take heed of.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There are ſome things you muſt do, and thoſe I ſhall comprize under 2 or 3 heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In caſe you would keep aſſurance, you are to keep cloſe in communion with your God, in the exerciſe of the duty of godlineſſe. The more you keep grace, the more you will keep your comforts. And here that I may branch out this direction, I ſhall comprize theſe duties under four heads, and ſhew you from Scripture, that keeping cloſe to God in the uſe of four duties, will be a ready way to keep your aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in you.</p>
               <p>As firſt, keep cloſe to God in the duty of prayer, <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>Ask,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and your joy ſhall be full.</hi> Ask, that your joy may be full; implying that if you keep cloſe to God in the duty of prayer, after aſſurance; your ſpirits ſhall be compleat and full.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Keep cloſe to God, in the duty of reading the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115140:82"/>Word often. By often reading the Word, you will often meet with Promiſes and ſupports for your comfort. That's the reaſon men leſſen in comforts, becauſe men do not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently read the Word; you cannot read a Chapter, but you will finde there a prop for faith, and a prop for aſſurance. Keeping conſtant to the Word, and that's the way to keep your aſſurance, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I written to you that believe, that you might know, that you have eternal life.</hi> Theſe things have I writ, not onely, that you have life, but that you might know it. By reading the writings of <hi>John, John</hi> tells them, they might the better know they ſhould live for ever, and everlaſtingly be ſaved. Keep cloſe to God in reading his written Word, and this will be of great uſe. Becauſe there are Promiſes ſcattered throughout the veines of Scripture. Not a Scripture almoſt you can read, but there is a promiſe or ſupport for your faith one way o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Keep cloſe to God in a conſtant and conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearing of his Word, and this is a great means to get aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.76. <hi>Thou ſhalt be called the Prophet of the Higheſt, for thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his way;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt go to prepare the peoples hearts that they may receive Jeſus Chriſt that followes after. This is ſpoken of <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> And what was the effect of hearing <hi>John</hi> preach? <hi>To give knowlege of ſalvation to his people, for the remiſſion of their ſins;</hi> not onely to give them ſalvation, but to give them knowledge and aſſurance of this ſalvation. O live under the Miniſtery, and under <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, that preacheth repentance and humiliation, and that is the Miniſtery will give moſt aſſurance of your ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Keep in communion with God, in a daily try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and examining your own hearts. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>If any man think himſelfe to be ſomewhat, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himſelfe; but let every man prove his own works, and then he ſhall have rejoycing in himſelfe.</hi> That is, let a man examine himſelfe, and prove his heart, and this will be a means to work joy in the heart, that they ſhall have comfort and joy
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115140:83"/>in themſelves in the aſſurance of their happineſs. Beloved what's the reaſon you do not keep aſsurance? the reaſon is, you keep not cloſe to God in a way of communion in theſe duties of holineſse, you keep not to God in a way of prayer, and reading, and examining your hearts, and proving your comforts, and your own eſtate, and that's the reaſon you are no more full, and no more firm.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you would keep your comforts, keep your conſcience clear from harbouring the guilt of linne, <hi>Job</hi> 11.14 15. <hi>I iniquity be in thy hands, put it far away;</hi> if ſinne be in thy converſation, away with it. Let not ſinne be in thy heart, nor in thy houſe; <hi>then ſhalt thou liſt up thy face to God without ſpot, thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt before him, and not fear.</hi> This will ballance thy ſpirit, and keep thy heart from fear, and keep thee in a ſtedfaſt aſsurance, if thou keep thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience clear.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If thou wouldſt keep aſsurance, gather and heap together all the experiences thou haſt had of God in thy heart in times paſt. <hi>I called to remembrance the dayes of old, Pſal.</hi> 77.7. Call to remembrance all the experiences thou haſt had of God, and had of Chriſt, and of thy own grace, and the fruits of Gods Spirit in thy own ſoul, and this will wonderfully keep up thy aſsurance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. The Apoſtle tels us, <hi>Experience worketh hope.</hi> The more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental you are, and the more you gather experience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the more you ſtrengthen hope, and the more hope is ſtrengthened, the more aſsurance is gained. Theſe are the particulars you muſt practiſe, in caſe you would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in your breſt this aſsurance of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are ſome things you are to avoid and take heed of, in caſe you would perpetuate aſsurance in your hearts, and thoſe I ſhall comprize under ſix heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Take heed you do not wallow in, and give your ſelves to ſenſual joy and pleaſure. There is nothing in the world will more eat out ſpiritual joy and that effectual aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in your hearts, then giving your ſelves too much to carnal joy and ſenſual pleaſure, which takes away the heart.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115140:83"/>The more your joy runnes in that channel after ſenſual pleaſure, the leſs it runs towards God, and the comforts that are above; godly ſorrow is the ſeed plot of ſpiritual joy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The evill of earthly mindedneſs, take heed of that, if ever you would keep your comforts. There is nothing in the world will more blaſt your comforts, then an earthly minde to be ſtill poring upon the things of the world. What the Philoſophers ſay of the Eclipſe of the Sun, that it is occaſioned by the intervening of the Moon between the Sun &amp; our ſight is true in this caſe. The Moon is an emblem of the world. If the world get between Chriſt <hi>the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes</hi> and our ſight, it will darken our ſight of Jeſus Chriſt, and bring eclipſes upon our comforts and graces. Thoſe men that dig deepeſt into the bowels of the earth, they are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times choaked and ſtifled by damps that come from the earth: So it is with Chriſtians, thoſe that will be ever poring and digging about the things of this world, it is a thouſand to one, if from worldly things a damp doth not ariſe to ſmother their comforts, and quench their graces; the world pierceth with ſorrow, therefore muſt needs damp your joys. A candle, though it may ſhine to the view of all, yet put it but under ground; and (though there be not a puffe of winde) the very damps will ſtifle the light of the flame. Beloved, though you ſhine like candles in your comforts, yet bring them but under the earth, and a clod of earth will ſtifle your candle, will damp your comforts. There is nothing laies a Chriſtian under more loſſe in his aſſurance then worldly-mindedneſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Avoid remiſſeneſs in religious duties. If you ſlack in duties, you will ſlack in comforts; leſſe duties, and leſſe comforts go together. If a man doth let looſe the tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of his ſhip, and let ſlack the ſailes, that ſhip cannot go with ſo ſwift a motion; ſpecially if winde and tide be againſt it, the ſhip muſt needs go backward: Believers that are aſſured Chriſtians, they are like a ſhip under ſaile; you go againſt winde and tide, againſt nature, and againſt corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, againſt Temptation and the devil and all: now if you let ſlack your ſailes, and grow remiſſe in duties, you will
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115140:84"/>quickly ſlack in your comforts; whatever weakens your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſtraitens your duties, will impaire your aſsurances, and eclipſe your comforts; and therefore take heed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſseneſs in a way of duties; oh do not leſs work, when you have moſt encouragement.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Take heed of ſpiritual pride. If once you begin to admire your ſelves, you then loſe your ſelves. If once you are proud of your graces, it is a provocation to make God take away your comforts, and to make you loſe your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; I mean, loſe them, not in the very being, but in the comfort and exerciſe of them; pride it is the great mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of a Chriſtians comforts.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take heed of grieving the Spirit of God; <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>whereby you are ſealed to the day of Redemption.</hi> The Spirit of God is a ſealing Spirit; O grieve not this Spirit.
<note place="margin">Ità nos tractat Spiritus ſicut tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatur.</note> The Spirit deals with us, as we deal with it; If you grieve the Spirit of God, God will grieve you, and your ſpirits ſhall be grieved, that you ſhall not keep the joyes of the Lord in your breſt in the aſſurance of his love and favour to you. You read, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63.10. <hi>They grieved his Spirit, ſo he was turned to be their enemy, and fought againſt them.</hi> Beloved, though God may be your friend, yet he will frown upon you as an enemy, and ſeem to fight againſt you too, in caſe you grieve his Spirit; if thou grieve Gods Spirit, God will grieve thine, and when thy ſpirit is grieved, thou muſt needs loſe thy comforts.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Take heed of the ſinne of hypocriſie, falſe grace will breed a falſe joy. A falſe heart muſt needs have falſe comforts. You will never keep true comforts, if you have an unſound heart. <hi>The upright in heart they ſhall ſhout upon their beds for joy;</hi> they ſhall do it, but hypocrites ſhall not. Take heed therefore of this evill, and you are in a way to preſerve your aſſurance.</p>

Firſt, That you would rightly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage your aſſurance. Secondly, Carefully preſerve your aſſurance. Thirdly, Daily improve your aſſurance; the laſt of which I have yet to handle And touching this third direction, daily to improve your aſſurance, I ſhall give you but three heads; which if you make uſe of, you may every day improve your aſſurance, and bring it from a little to a great meaſure. As</p>

Hence you read, that in the ſaluation of every Epiſtle, the Apoſtle puts both together, <hi>Grace, mercy, and peace be multiplied to you in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. There the Apoſtle makes the multiplying of grace, to be the multiplying of peace. The more you multiply
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115140:85"/>and grow in grace, the more you will increaſe peace, inward peace of conſcience: they are both joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

And what will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? verſe 11. <hi>If you doe theſe things, you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall; for ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abundantly into the everlaſting Kingdome of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> You ſhall not onely go to heaven, but you ſhall have an abundant entrance miniſtred before you come there; you ſhall have abundance of aſſurance and inward peace before you come there. And here to give you a more particular direction, there are theſe foure graces chiefly you are to improve.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Improve the grace of humility. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57.15. the Lord doth promiſe there <hi>to revive the ſpirit of the humble.</hi> It is a particular promiſe to that grace, that God will revive you, and give you a new life if you have it. And reviving there is not meant of the firſt life of grace, but of a life of comfort. They had grace before, but God would give them a life of comfort, he will reſtore your conſolation to you in caſe you are a humble peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Hence it is, <hi>James</hi> 4.6. <hi>The Lord gives grace to the humble.</hi> Yea, <hi>he gives more grace.</hi> The Lord gives more grace to the humble perſon then to any man in the world. Now the more grace you have, the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you muſt needs have. Humility is a foundation of more grace, therefore needs muſt be a foundation of more comfort.</p>
               <p>That building, whoſe foundation is laid loweſt, is of all the moſt beautiful and comely Fabrick above ground: So thoſe Chriſtians that lay a foundation low in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they are likely to rear up a moſt beautiful Building in way of comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Improve the grace of faith in believing, and that is the way to increaſe comfort. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.8.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115140:85"/>
                  <hi>Whom though you have not ſeen, yet believing, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> Though they did never ſee Chriſt, yet believing in Chriſt, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their faith, they had not only an ordinary meaſure of comfort, but they had more comfort in their hearts, then they could utter with their Tongue; <hi>They rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>The God of peace fill you with all joy and peace in Believing, that you may abound in hope through the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Believing makes you full of all joy, and makes you abound in it. The more you are in Believing, the more you will be in aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Improve the grace of love to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>If any man love me, my Father ſhall love him, and we will come in unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> That is, If you improve in your love to Jeſus Chriſt, God the Father and God the Son will make their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in your hearts. Now he muſt needs be a comfortable Chriſtian, that hath ſo good a gueſt as God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt to come in, and make their abode with him. As you know, to your boſome-friend whom you love, and you know loves you, you will communicate all your ſecrets: Thus will God the Father, if hee knowes you are his boſome-friends, and ſeeth you love him, he will communicate all his comforts to you; you ſhall never want comforts, if you increaſe in love to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Improve the grace of godly ſorrow; you will never finde ſweeter muſick in comfort, then when you are laid down in teares. As the ſound of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet is never more pleaſant then when they are upon the water; ſo when God ſeeth you flow with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of repentance and godly ſorrow, then you are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear the moſt melodious harmony in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Gods love; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. <hi>They that ſowe in tears, ſhall reap in joy.</hi> You ſhall not onely have a dram, but a handfull of joy; as Reapers they cut down handfuls
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115140:86"/>of corne at once. And as you know in ſeed, though you ſowe but one grain of corne, there may a dozen eares come from that one ſeed: ſo if you ſowe but a little godly ſorrow, a grain of godly ſorrow may be a root to a great deal of ſpiritual joy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would improve your aſſurance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a clear conſcience, both towards God and man. <hi>A good conſcience is a continual feaſt, Prov.</hi> 15.15. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I may ſay of it as a Father ſpeaks of the Holy Ghoſt,
<note place="margin">Res delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta eſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus Dei.</note> and the comforts thereof, The Spirit of God is a very nice thing, every thing will give the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Gods Spirit a check and diſtaſte; now if you harbour ſinne upon conſcience, you will never thrive in comfort; every thing will give comfortable motions a check. And as Philoſophers ſay when the Aire is fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, it ariſeth from vapours that are exhaled from the earth, which makes the aire ſo cloudy as it is; So it is filth drawn from our earthly hearts, that makes ſuch foggy miſts to ariſe between our comforts and us, and between God and us. You muſt keep conſcience clear, elſe you will never keep heaven clear. Heaven will be clouded, if the heart be filthy. <hi>Job</hi> 11.14, 15. <hi>If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away;</hi> If ſinne be upon the conſcience, harbour it not, <hi>for then thou ſhalt lift up thy face before God, thou ſhalt be ſtedfast, and not fear.</hi> You ſhall not only not fear, but you ſhall have a degree of aſſurance. You ſhall be ſtedfaſt, if you put ſinne far away from you. A ſullied and a polluted conſcience ſhall never be in a Chriſtian ſtrong in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. You will not grow in aſſurance, if your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence harbour guilt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you would improve your aſſurance, keep cloſe in communion with God. Nothing that feeds comforts ſo much as a Chriſtians holy walking, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>The work of righteouſneſſe ſhall be peace, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof quietneſſe and aſſurance for ever.</hi> If you walk in works of righteouſneſſe, and in a way of keeping
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115140:86"/>cloſe communion with God; this ſhall be peace, and this ſhall be quietneſſe, and great aſſurance. Mark how the Holy Ghoſt makes a gradation; not onely peace and quietneſſe, but aſſurance alſo: you ſhall have the higheſt degree of peace, and the higheſt ſtep of comfort, if you walk diligently in a way of holineſſe with your God. And thus much be ſpoken to the firſt ſort of men, thoſe that live in the enjoyment of the aſſurance of their effectual calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> I have now a word to thoſe men that live in the want of this aſſurance,  who happily have in times paſt had ſome glimmering, and ſome dimme ſight of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, touching their everlaſting eſtate, and yet are now much clouded and eclipſed in their comforts, or have loſt the comforts they once had, what they ſhould do to recover it. And to theſe I ſhall by way of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpeak only four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That you would ſet upon ſearching work. Secondly, Upon humbling work. Thirdly, Upon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work. And fourthly, that you would ſet upon me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating work: Theſe four helpes will through Gods Bleſſing be very conducible to reſtore your wonted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, My counſel ſhall be to you, that you would ſet upon ſearching and examining work. When you have loſt any thing, the firſt thing you do is to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, where you have loſt it, that you may finde it again. If you have loſt this precious jewel of aſſurance, be thus wiſe for your ſelves; O ſet upon ſeeking and ſearching work. The Scripture gives you this hint, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Let every man ſearch his own work, and then he ſhall have rejoycing in himſelfe.</hi> This is the way to bring in ſpiritual joy and ſpiritual comfort, to be often deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your own hearts. <hi>David</hi> when he lay under ſome foule diſtemper, mark how he deales with his own ſoule: <hi>Why art thou troubled, O my ſoule, and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> he puts his heart
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115140:87"/>upon the Trial. And here in your ſearching work, I would commend five things to your examination.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Search how you got your aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Search how you grounded your aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Search how you managed your aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Search what ſhould provoke God to take away your aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, Search what you would give to God, ſo you might regain your former and wonted aſſurance. Put theſe queſtions to your hearts; As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Put upon the ſearch, how you got your aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. It may be it was ſuch an aſſurance as you have had ever ſince you were borne from your mothers womb: that you got without care, and without pain; and if ſo, this is preſumption, not aſſurance; and if you have loſt this, it is well. It is better to be in a ſtate of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, then in a ſtate of preſumption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Examine how you grounded your aſſurance. It may be you bottomed it but upon ſelfe, not upon Chriſt. It may be, you bottomed it but upon the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical deluſions of your own hearts, and not upon the grounded evidence of Gods Word; if ſo, that your aſſurance have had an ill bottome, it is no wonder if God turne it upſide-down. If it bee not rightly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will never long bee continued. Examine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon what grounds you have bottomed your aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and if you finde the foundation of your comforts to be ill laid, you muſt pluck up all again.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Search how you managed your aſſurance. It may be you managed your aſſurance with pride, not humility; it may be with unwatchfulneſſe, and careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, and did not take notice of thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and ſuggeſtions that might impaire your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; and if ſo, it is no wonder if the devil ſowes tares amongſt your wheat; it is no wonder if the devil have ſtollen away your comforts, if you have laid down your watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:115140:87"/>Fourthly, Examine what ſpecial cauſe there was in your hearts, that might provoke God to cloud you in your comforts, and to take away your aſſurance from you. And here that you might a little bee directed in this ſearch, you may reduce the cauſe of your eclipſe, and of the removal of your aſſurance, unto this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold head. Either it hath been the commiſſion of ſome great tranſgreſſion, or elſe the omiſſion of ſome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty duty, that may provoke God to darken your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Commiſſion of ſome great tranſgreſſion. Great ſins they lay a foundation for great diſcomforts in tender conſciences.
<note place="margin">Vaſtare conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</note> Great ſins they lay the conſcience waſte; to make it that was as a well-trimmed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paled garden, to be as a ruinous wilderneſſe. Great relapſes they bring ordinarily dark eclipſes upon the ſoule. And here that I might put you on this ſearch, I would adviſe you to ſearch what particular ſinne it was, and how you might know the tranſgreſſion that might provoke God, to take away your comforts from you. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, if ſo be God did take away your comforts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the committing of any groſſe ſin, then you may be ſure that ſinne was the occaſion. Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the commiſſion of any ſin, doth bring upon you more then an ordinary meaſure of hardneſſe of heart, then you may be ſure that was the ſin. Or,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If any ſinne makes you remiſſe in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duties, that was the ſinne provoked God to take away your comforts from you. And by ſuch a ſearch as this, you might finde out, and give a ſhrewd gueſſe at the particular provocation.</p>
               <p>And here the particular tranſgreſſions I would have you ſearch about, they are ordinarily theſe four, that ingages God to take away comforts from a people. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ſinne of ſuperciliouſneſſe, and uncompaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateneſſe of ſpirit towards doubting Chriſtians. If a ſoul
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115140:88"/>carries a proud and ſupercilious eye over poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and carries no compaſſion towards doubting ſouls. God for that ſinne of wanting bowels of compaſſion, may bring him to the ſame eſtate, which he could not compaſſionate in other men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſinne of grieving the Spirit; if you grieve Gods Spirit, God will grieve yours, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63.10. Or,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſinne of ſpiritual pride; ordinarily this may be the ſinne. Or,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The ſinne of worldly-mindedneſſe, or eager purſuit after the things of this world. As digging in the earth doth endanger a man to bee ſtifled with damps; ſo digging and poring in the world brings but a damp upon a Chriſtians comforts, and many times ſtifles their aſſurance. As the Sun is eclipſed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the Moone between it and our ſight; ſo if the world once get between the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and you, it will eclipſe the Sunne that you ſhall not ſee the glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nor gain that intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt you had in former time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another cauſe you are to ſearch; If it be not the commiſſion of ſome great tranſgreſſion, yet it may be the omiſſion of ſome neceſſary and weighty du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Lord may bring you upon the ſtage of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort for omiſſion as well as commiſſion. If a man doth let but a wound go undreſſed, he may as well die, as if you knockt him with a Beetle upon the head: Beloved, if you let your wounds be undreſſed, and let your diſcomforts be unlooked after, and let all run at ſixes and ſevens; if you interrupt in your duties, it is juſt with God to interrupt you in your comforts. If you keep not your watch, 'tis no wonder if you are ſurprized. There are many Chriſtians that grow careleſſe in keeping communion with God, that love ſeldome reading, and ſeldome praying, and ſeldome examining their owne
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115140:88"/>hearts; (alas) men caſting away their duties, it makes God in judgement make ſtoppage in a way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In your ſearching work examine your ſelves, what you would do in caſe God ſhould reſtore to you your former evidences; could you bring your hearts to this temper, that you would think no pains too much to take, no coſt too much to give, nothing ſhould be irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to you that God would have you perform, in caſe he would give you your wonted comforts? If you finde this temper of ſpirit in you, this is a very ready way to bring on your comforts, and reſtore the joyes of your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Set upon humbling work: the onely way to gain what you have loſt, is to mourn over your loſſes. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20. See how <hi>Ephraim</hi> comes to have his comforts reſtored, when he wept over his own diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: <hi>I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelfe,</hi> ſaith God, and I ſaid, <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſonne, I ſaw him ſmiting upon his thigh,</hi> humbling his ſoul for his ſinnes; <hi>and ſince I ſaw him, I do earneſtly remember him, and I will ſhew mercy to him.</hi> Here you ſee lamenting <hi>Ephraim;</hi> God in the very time of his bemoaning himſelf, reſtored his comforts to him: we hear many lament for their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward loſſes, but who laments for the loſſe of inward comforts? And <hi>David</hi> after he had loſt his comforts by that great ſinne of adultery, makes ſeven penitential Pſalmes, Pſalmes of lamentation or repentance; and he calls one of them, <hi>A Pſalm to call to remembrance.</hi> And as an Authour well notes, when <hi>David</hi> came to renew his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, he makes a Pſalm to call to remembrance thoſe ſinnes that might provoke God to take away his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from him: So Beloved, let it be your work to make ſuch Pſalms in your Cloſets, and make it your practice to call to remembrance thoſe evils that provoke God to eclipſe your comforts to you, and let that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you. If you cannot find out the Particular ſin, labour to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115140:89"/>humble your ſoules for every ſinne, and then to be ſure you cannot miſſe that.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Would you reſtore your wonted comforts? then ſet upon praying work. This courſe you finde <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> took; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Make me, O Lord, to hear the voice of joy and gladneſſe, that the bones which thou hast broken might rejoyce. Create in me a new heart, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſh me with thy free Spirit,</hi> verſe 12. Here you read of <hi>Davids</hi> praying work, how he poured forth his ſoule in prayer, that God would reſtore to him the joyes of his ſalvation. And here in your praying work I would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt in three directions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Pray for a diſtinct ſight of thoſe evils that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God to take your comforts from you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, After you have got a ſight, bend the ſtrength of your prayers moſt againſt thoſe evils that did ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to cloud your comforts. Pray againſt them, as againſt the deadlieſt enemy you have in the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Pray for attaining thoſe graces that may be inlets to ſpiritual comfort, as the graces before named: the grace of godlie ſorrow, the grace of humiliation, the grace of faith, and of love to Jeſus Chriſt. Thus if you ſet upon ſearching, upon humbling, and upon praying work, you are in a likely way to have your comforts reſtored.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Set upon the work of meditation; and in this work, I ſhall commend four meditations you are to take into your thoughs, which may be very helpful and uſeful to you in reſtoring your comforts. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let your meditations run upon this, that ſometimes you are not ſo competent Judges of your own ſpiritual eſtate, as others may be; As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, In a time of deſertion, when God hath left you and frownes upon you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In times of temptation, when the devils temptations are violent againſt you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In times of Relapſe, when you are fallen into ſome great ſinne; at this time you are not ſo compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115140:89"/>Judges of your own eſtate, but ſtanders by may ſee more of your own good, and your own ſincerity, then your ſelves may do; as the Proverb is: Many times Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on ſee more then he that playes the game; it is true in this. A Looker on may ſee ſincerity ſparkle in thy practice, and thy graces ſhine in thy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when thou canſt not do it thy ſelfe. A childe when it blubbers and cries, can ſee nothing of his book. So when Chriſtians are ſad, and ſullen, and lumpiſh, they can hardly read any thing of their evidence. Mr. <hi>Throgmorton</hi> got his aſſurance this way, by the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a company of godly Miniſters that they could lay their ſoules in his ſoules ſtead. Let this therefore run in your Meditations, that many times ſtanders by and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that behold your walkings, and ſee your Actions, they may ſee more ground of comfort in you then your ſelves can do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Meditate and think upon the comforts God gave you in wonted time, and call them to minde. Do as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. <hi>I called to minde the dayes of old, and the yeers of many generations.</hi> Call to minde ancient dayes, did not God ſhew thee his face? did not God bear thee in the palmes of his hands? did not God give thee many a ſmile of his countenance, and many a pledge of his love, even by affliction it ſelfe? did not God ſet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſeal upon thy heart, that thy comforts were true, thy evidence clear, and thy ends ſincere towards God? Beloved, call to minde the former frame of thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, how thou waſt in wonted times, and this Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being backed by Gods Spirit, may bee a great means to reſtore thy comforts to thee; paſt goodneſſe ſhould be preſent encouragement.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Meditate what way it was that you got your former comforts and aſſurance;
<note place="margin">Ex quo gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimur eo dem nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</note> and the ſame way God will ſanctifie to reſtore you your comforts again. What Phyſicians ſay of the body, We are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed of thoſe things, of which wee are begotten and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115140:90"/>generated. So I ſay of comforts: The very ſame thing that begot comforts, the ſame will reſtore your comforts againe. Now think upon this in your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and conſider, What way did I gaine my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in yeeres paſt? did I gaine my comforts by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow, and by lamenting after God, and by mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over thoſe abominable failings in my practice? now take the ſame courſe to reſtore thy evidences. Go and mourn in thy Cloſet over thy uneven walking before God. Go lament for thy ſinnes, mourne after thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and tell him thou art grieved at the heart that he is ſo great a ſtranger to thy ſoule. Didſt thou gain thy aſſurance in dayes paſt by humbling thy ſoule often before God? Set upon humbling work again. Didſt thou gain thy comforts in dayes paſt by walking cloſely with thy God? Amend thy paths, and direct thy wayes unto thy Maker for dayes to come. There is the very ſame way to reſtore your comforts, that was at firſt to gain your comforts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Let your Meditations work upon thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Promiſes in the Goſpel, that hold forth moſt comfort to a dejected ſoule. And truly I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Chriſtians Meditations running more upon their own failings, and their own jealouſies, and their own miſtakes, then upon Goſpel-Promiſes, hath been the great occaſion they have layen ſo long under a ſpirit of bondage, and under a dark eclipſe in the want of the comforts of Gods Spirit. Therefore now let your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations work upon thoſe Promiſes that hold forth moſt comfort to a dejected and deſerted ſoule. And here. I ſhall name five or ſixe moſt comfortable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the Word; As <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>The Lord that dwells in the high and holy places, he doth revive the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the humble, and of the contrite one.</hi> So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66.2. <hi>The Lord dwels in the heavens, and yet with him alſo that is of an humble and contrite ſpirit, that trembles at his Word;</hi> with him will God dwell. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.18.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115140:90"/>
                  <hi>The Lord is nigh them that are of a broken heart, even them that are contrite in ſpirit. So Luke</hi> 4.18. Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>anointed,</hi> that is, appointed by God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>to preach the Goſpel to the poor, to binde up the broken in heart, and to comfort them that mourn.</hi> So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66.10. <hi>The Lord will reſtore comfort to thee, and to thy Mourners.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12. <hi>The Lord will ſtrengthen the weak hands, and feeble knees.</hi> And with that remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and moſt glorious Goſpel-promiſe I ſhall end, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 35.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Strengthen the weak hands, and confirme the feeble knees.</hi> This, ſaith God, to weak Chriſtians, whoſe legs can hardly carry their bodies, and their hands hardly reach to their mouthes. Say unto the weak Chriſtian in grace, comfort, and confirm and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them: <hi>And ſay unto them that are of a fearfull heart, Be ſtrong;</hi> Poor fearful doubting ſoules, that fear every Temptation, and fear every corruption, and fear they ſhall loſe the recompence of their reward: Say unto that fearful heart, Be ſtrong and fear not. <hi>For your God will come with vengeance, even God will come with recompence, and ſave you. And then the eyes of the blinde ſhall bee open, and the eares of the deafe ſhall bee unſtopped;</hi> it is not meant of the bodily eye but thoſe that were blinde, and could not ſee the myſteries of Chriſt, and could not read their own comforts; then their eyes ſhall be open. And the deaf that, as <hi>Eſaiah</hi> ſaith, refuſed to be comforted, that would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to comfort, but would ſtop their eares againſt all comfortable doctrines, and onely give way to ſorrow, their eares ſhall be unſtopped. <hi>And the lame man ſhall leap like a Hart;</hi> the poore halting Chriſtian, that halts in his comforts, that is now believing, anon ſtaggering; now rejoycing, anon deſpairing; the poor lame man ſhall leap like a Hart. <hi>And the Tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing:</hi> the poor man that could not ſpeak one word of his owne graces, and of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and touching his own evidence, <hi>the Tongue of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115140:91"/>the dumb ſhall ſing.</hi> O Beloved, here is your work, in caſe you would bee Chriſtians to reſtore your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts againe; ſet upon the work of Meditation, to think upon theſe precious promiſes of the Goſpell, that hold forth moſt comfort to a drooping and dejected ſinner.</p>

               <p>THe Doctrine I am yet upon is this, <hi>That Chriſtians ought to put forth a great deale of diligence, to make this ſure to their ſoule, that they are effectually called by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to Grace and Glory.</hi> In the proſecution of which, I have gone over many particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> There remains now onely one Uſe more to diſpatch about this ſubject,  and then I paſſe to the third point drawn from theſe words. And the Uſe ſhall be of Conſolation; from all that hath been ſaid touching the aſſurance of our effectuall Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I ſhall onely direct my diſcourſe to lay down ſix or ſeven Conſolatory Concluſions, to thoſe Chriſtians who are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, yet happily have not a ſenſible aſſurance of their own calling.</p>
               <p>Firſt, take this for a truth; that Aſſurance is neceſſary, not for the being, but for the wel-being of a Chriſtian. It is not neceſſary to his eſtate, but to his comfort. It is not neceſſary as food is to the life, but onely as phyſick is to the body. A man cannot live without food; a man may live without Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. Aſſurance is but as a comfortable Cordiall to the ſoule; Grace is as food to keep the ſoule alive; though you doe want aſſurance, this Cordiall to beare you up.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that many of Gods deare Children, they may lie a very long time in the want of this aſſurance, touching their effectuall calling. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. it is ſaid of <hi>Heman,</hi> 14, 15, 16 verſes, <hi>Lord, why haſt thou caſt off my ſoule? and why haſt thou hid thy face from me?</hi> Mark his complaint: <hi>I am ready to die.</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:115140:92"/>And was this onely a fit of deſertion, or was it a continued act? yes; Verſ. 16. <hi>From my youth up I ſuffer thy terrours, I am diſtracted, and thy fierce wrath goes over me. Heman</hi> lay under the ſtate of deſertion from his childhood; for here he tels you his eſtate, that he was not troubled for a day or two, or three, and then his troubles were over; but from his youth up he lay under this perplexity, that he thought God had caſt off his ſoule, and the terrours of God lay upon him: And yet this man none queſtions his goodneſſe. For he was the man, as <hi>Ainſworth</hi> thinks, that made this Pſalm; and ſure God would never honour a wicked man to be a pen-man of the Scripture. The Pſalm is called a golden Pſalm; and it is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hereby he would teach afflicted conſciences, that they may from their youth up lie under great horror, and lie under ſad ſuſpence, concerning their everlaſting eſtate, and yet they may have grace at the root for all this. And <hi>Heman</hi> doth not onely expreſſe it, as if he had an ordinary trouble of mind; but he expreſſeth it, that he lay under an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary weight of Gods wrath, Verſ. 7. <hi>thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt laid me in the loweſt pit of darkneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and in the deep, and thy wrath it lies heavy upon me.</hi> He did even lie, and ſinke, in his own thoughts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of Gods wrath upon him. This therefore is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfortable concluſion, That godly men may not onely by fits and ſtarts, but for a long time, for many yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lie under a ſtate of ſpirituall deſertion. For ſome men think of <hi>Heman,</hi> that he was above threeſcore yeeres of age, when he wrote this Pſalm; yet from his youth up, till that age, he lay under this horrour and perplexity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that many of Gods deare children may be ſo long plunged under deſertion, and under the want of Aſſurance, that they may refuſe and withſtand comforts, when God offers it to them in the Goſpel, and yet may have grace ſtill. As a man in a fever, or diſtracted by ſome violent diſeaſe, though you bring him a Cordiall, that may abate his diſeaſe, the man in a fit will throw the glaſſe againſt the wall, though it be the onely means of his remedy. It is ſo with godly men; many times they are ſo accuſtomed to ſadneſſe in the want of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115140:92"/>aſſurance, that they may refuſe comforts when God offers them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2. It is the ſpeech of <hi>Aſaph, my ſoule refuſeth to be comforted;</hi> a ſtrange ſpeech: Though he was offered comfort, yet his ſoule refuſed it. Here then, Beloved, this may be a very great prop to thee, that thou mayſt ſo long be accuſtomed to a courſe of doubting, that thou mayſt refuſe comfort when God tenders it, and yet be a gracious heart ſtill.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and this is more comfortable yet. That rather then God will let his people live and die without aſſurance, he wil work aſſurance in you by a miracle, or by ſome unuſual or extraordinary way. A famous inſtance you have for this, of a Gentlewoman, that once lived in this City, (its Mr. <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> that relates the ſtory) one Mris. <hi>Honywood;</hi> who was a famous profeſſour of Religion, and a woman that for many yeeres was much troubled in mind for the want of her aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. At length there came a Miniſter to her, who endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſettle her hopes and comforts in Jeſus Chriſt; and he urging promiſes to her, ſhe took it with a kind of indignation &amp; anger, that he ſhould offer to preſent any promiſe to her, to whom ſhe thought it did not belong; and having a Venice glaſſe in her hand, ſhe holds up the glaſſe and ſaid, Speak no more to me of ſalvation, for I ſhall as ſurely be damned, as this poore Venice Glaſſe ſhall be broken againſt the wall, throwing it with all her force to break it. But it pleaſed God, by a miraculous providence to preſerve the glaſſe whole. The Miniſter ſeeing this, took up the glaſſe, and ſaid, Behold, God muſt by a miracle work faith in you, before you will believe. And from that day, the ſtory ſaith, ſhe was a woman very ſtrong in the aſſurance of Gods love. Here you ſee how God did indulge the infirmity of his poore ſervant. Rather then thou ſhalt live and die without aſſurance, God will bring it about even by a miracle; this woman, it may be, had died unaſſured, if God had not confirmed her by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall way. I have read likewiſe in the book of Martyrs, of Mr. <hi>Glover,</hi> that all the while he was in priſon, he was under a ſtate of deſertion, and very much clouded in his comforts, and could not have any apprehenſion of Gods love to his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115140:93"/>ſoule. Yet when he came to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and ſaw the ſtake, and the fire in which he was to be burnt, he cried out, I have found him, I have found him; and profeſt of himſelfe, he was as full of joy as his heart could hold. The Lord made the very ſight of the Stake to be an inlet to preſent joy. One would have thought that the ſight of the ſtake ſhould have daunted him; whereas he then grew moſt confident.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That though grace in thy heart be unchangeable, yet the ſenſe and feeling of thy own graces is ſubject to great variation and change. Grace in it ſelfe is unchangeable. All the divels in hell cannot pluck the meaneſt believer out of Chriſts hand. <hi>Thoſe whom thou haſt given me, I will keep,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and none ſhall take them from me. The foundation of God ſtands ſure;</hi> though thy knowledge, that thou buildeſt upon that foundation may not be ſure to thee. <hi>The Lord knows who are his,</hi> though thou mayſt not. Grace it ſelfe is not change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though thy feeling of grace is ſubject to many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and changes. Though grace it ſelfe be an unſhaken foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, yet our feeling of grace is not ſo. In our feeling of grace, we are like the aire, ſometimes cleare, ſometimes clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; we are like the ſea, ſometimes ebbing, ſometimes flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ebbing in your comforts, as well as flowing in your graces. Believers in their feeling of grace, are like the Trees of the field, ſometimes flouriſhing green, and growing; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, at the fall of the leafe, like a withered ſtump. So are Chriſtians, touching their own feeling; their apprehenſion of their graces is ſubject to much change, though their graces be not ſo.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That the want of Aſſurance is not ſimply prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian, though it be prejudiciall to the Conſolation of a Chriſtian. It is no way prejudiciall to your ſalvation, but you may be ſaved, though you are not aſſured. For firſt, this want of aſſurance is no prejudice to your free acceſſe to the Throne of grace: you may come freely to preſent your requeſts to God, though you are not aſſured of acceptance. As it is the ſaying of an Authour: Though God ſhewes thee not his face, yet he may lend thee
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115140:93"/>his eare, when thou comeſt to him in prayer; God lends many a Chriſtian an eare in prayer, though they ſee not his face, nor the glimps of his favour. Secondly, Thy want of aſſurance ſhall not hinder thy ſucceſſe in prayer, but thou maiſt goe away with an ample returne, though thou doeſt not goe away with fulneſſe of comfort. <hi>Benjamin</hi> when he was with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in Aegypt, he had a token of love from <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> a Golden Cup in his ſacke, though he knew it not. This is a lively Emblem of the carriage of our <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt to his young <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins,</hi> who may put a love token in your hearts, and may give you a Golden Cup, and give you grace, and you not know that grace is there. And Laſtly, It doth not hinder your reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, but you may be at peace with God, though you know not that the agreement is made up; There may be reall friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between God and a Believer, though there may be ſome ſeeming enmity. <hi>Thou holdeſt me for thine enemy</hi> ſaith <hi>Iob,</hi> yet God did not, though he thought ſo. <hi>Zion</hi> ſaid, <hi>the Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me,</hi> Iſa. 49.14. But God had not done ſo, for he tells them a little before, almoſt in one breath, <hi>Though a mother may forget her ſucking child, yet will I not forget you:</hi> So that there may be ſome ſeeming jarres when there is no enmity at all between God and you.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That Chriſtians, who have attained the ſtrongeſt and higheſt degree of faith, have yet had many defects and doubtings mingled with their faith. <hi>Lord, I believe,</hi> Mark. 9. <hi>Yet helpe my unbeliefe,</hi> yet that man attained to a high pitch of faith, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Night and day we pray exceedingly for you that we may ſee your face, and perfect that which is wanting in your faith.</hi> Now you muſt not take theſe <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> as if they were new Converts, or a people weake in the faith; but herein lies the Emphaſis, that though theſe <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were the moſt eminent Chriſtians of all the world, yet they had a great defect in their faith. Therefore compare this with 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>You were examples to all that believe in</hi> Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, <hi>and</hi> Achaia, <hi>for from you ſounded out the word of the Lord not onely in</hi> Macedonia <hi>and</hi> Achaia, <hi>but alſo in every place your faith to Godward is ſpread abroad.</hi> The people in every place
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115140:94"/>ſpake of the great meaſure of faith that was in the godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Church, and yet though their faith was ſo eminent, and they Chriſtians ſo eminent as they were, yet they had ſome defects; and there was ſomewhat lacking in their faith for all this. See alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.5. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. So that here is very great comfort for Believers, that the ſtrongeſt Chriſtians in the faith have had great defects that have attended their graces.</p>
               <p>Thus having finiſhed theſe ſeven comfortable Concluſions, becauſe I would have no deluded ſinner nuzled up in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous perſwaſions of his owne bleſſedneſſe, when he is a Curſed man, and deſigned for hell; I have two or three ſad concluſions to lay down, for all you that harbour ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and preſumptuous perſwaſions of your effectuall calling, when you are not. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, You that nouriſh preſumptuous perſwaſions of your effectuall calling, when you are not, take this concluſion to dread your hearts, That it is likely you ſhall never be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called by Jeſus Chriſt. There is no man ſo unlikely to be truely called by Chriſt, as that man that thinkes he is called when he is not. <hi>Math.</hi> 9. <hi>I came not to call the Righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> Righteous men <hi>i.e.</hi> that thought they were righteous, and in their owne eye thought they had grace and were as good as the beſt, <hi>I came not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>to call them, but ſinners, i.e.</hi> ſinners, that ſee their ſinne, and ſee their need of a Saviour, and are ſenſible of their loſt and undone condition without Chriſt, Chriſt came to ſave them, and to call them to repentance: Of all men in the world, you are moſt unlikely to be called that nouriſh ungrounded perſwaſions of your effectuall calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whilſt you live in this world, you are meere ſtrangers to that inward and ſpirituall joy which every true Believer feeles and findeth in Jeſus Chriſt. You <hi>doe not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with thoſe inward ſolaces, and ſweet enjoyments of heart,</hi> which every ſincere believer hath in Jeſus Chriſt. A man that hath aſſurance upon good ground, he is ſo filled with joy, that it wil bear him up againſt all the ſufferings and ſorrows he
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115140:94"/>may meet with here in the world. He that hath aſſurance, no ſufferings can daunt him. As <hi>Adolphus Clarebachius,</hi> when he was burning at the ſtake, he was ſo filled with the aſſurance of Gods love, that he ſaith of himſelfe, I think in my heart, there is not a merrier heart in the world, then mine is. And ſo another Martyr burning at the ſtake ſaith, I taſte as much ſweetneſſe, and finde as much eaſe now I am in the flames, as if I lay upon a bed of Roſes. The fulneſſe of his joy in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods love, made him willingly undergoe any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> was in priſon, till hee was in priſon; <hi>Bainam</hi> ſaid, when he was in the fire, I feele no more then if I were in a bed of down. Whereas, thou that harboureſt falſe perſwaſions, thy hopes will ſhrink when thou commeſt to ſuffer, like cloath not well woven, on a rainy day; thy delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions will never beare up thy ſpirit to ſo high a pitch as theſe are. This is thy miſery, thou wilt never have that ſweet peace and rejoycing in thy heart Believers have, who are aſſured upon Scripture grounds.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, take this for thy dread, that thou wilt be thrown into hell, before thou art aware. It is the ſpeech of Mr. <hi>Bolton.</hi> That man that takes up a falſe perſwaſion of his effectuall Calling, when he is not, he is like unto a man that is in a pleaſant dream, who dreames he is a King, and hath a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and hath Treaſures full of Silver and Gold; yet when he awakes, behold the man hath nothing. He compares him likewiſe to a man that is aſleep upon the maſt of a ſhip; he is in a golden dream, and dreams of Kingdomes, and of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands which he hath, and happily in a moment the wind ariſeth, the ſhip is toſſed upon the waves, &amp; the man is tumbled into the Ocean and drowned. It is ſo with many men, who nouriſh Golden dreams, and hopes, that heaven is theirs, and Chriſt theirs; when as (alas) they are tumbled and thrown into hell, before they are aware. And this ſhould be a dreadfull meditation to thy heart, that harboureſt preſumptuous perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of thy effectuall Calling, when thou art not.</p>
               <p>Thus I have done in eleven Sermons with this Doctrine, touching effectuall calling. I paſſe now to the third and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115140:95"/>laſt point, drawn from theſe words: and that is,</p>
               <p>

                  </label> 
                  <hi>That Chriſtians ought to put forth a great deale of diligence to make this ſure to their ſoules, that they are eternally elected by God to life and ſalvation.</hi> Give diligence to make your Calling and election ſure.</p>
               <p>There are many profitable points to be handled in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of this Doctrine; I ſhall onely in this remnant of time proſecute a few. And firſt, I ſhall ſhew you what election is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether a man may be ſure of his own election, ſeeing election is an act from eternity. How can a man be ſure of that which was done in Gods counſell before we had a being? Thirdly, by what diſcoveries may a man infallibly judge, that he is elected.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Q. </seg>1</label> In the diſcuſſion of this doctrine, I begin with the firſt,  What election is?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">A. </seg>
                  </label> Which that you may know, I ſhall lay down this briefe deſcription of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Election is an eternall decree or purpoſe of God, whereby he hath freely choſen out of the maſſe of mankind a ſmall company of men and women, that ſhall come to everlaſting life and ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is election.</p>
               <p>And here in this deſcription there are theſe things to be taken notice of. Firſt, I call it an <hi>eternall purpoſe;</hi> becauſe, though a man be not juſtified from eternity, yet he is elected from eternity. God from eternity had a purpoſe that man ſhould be juſtified, and ſhould be called, and ſhould be ſaved. Election is from eternity, though vocation, juſtification, and glorification be not ſo. Hence you read in Scripture, when it ſpeaks of election, Eph. 1.4. <hi>He hath elected us in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world.</hi> But it is never ſaid ſo of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. God had a purpoſe to make us happy, and a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to call us in time, and a purpoſe to juſtifie us, from eternity, though the acting of this purpoſe is in due time ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. Secondly, I call it <hi>a purpoſe, whereby he doth freely chuſe.</hi> And this I doe in oppoſition to that Papiſticall Tenet, that God doth predeſtinate or elect men to ſalvation upon the foreſight of good works. A moſt abominable opinion; and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115140:95"/>takes off the freeneſs of this act of Gods election, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe &amp; grace:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 1.5.11.</note> ſo I ſay thirdly, <hi>Whereby God doth freely chuſe out of the maſſe of mankind a few to obtaine life and ſalvation.</hi> In oppoſition to thoſe that hold for univerſall Redemption, and univerſall Grace; As <hi>Origen,</hi> and from him many more have been tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this errour, to hold Election univerſall. And ſo many of the Papiſts: Now the Scripture tels us, that <hi>many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> Election ſignifies a choice; now a choice, the very word imports a rejecting of ſome, and a culling out of others. The word Election imports, that all ſhall not be ſaved. <hi>Origen</hi> held this, that all men ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; that Election ſhall extend to every man. Yea, the very divels at the day of judgement ſhall be ſaved: which is an opinion among Chriſtians not to be named; for Election belongs but to a few. Fourthly, I ſay, that tis to bring them to eternall life and ſalvation; therefore called ordination to eternall life, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Q. </seg>2</label> Secondly, Whether may a Chriſtian in this life be aſſured of his eternall Election; for as much as Election was done in the decree of God, before ever he had a being, or the world was? Therefore ſeeing we are not privy to Gods decree and counſell, how can it be ſaid, that we may know and be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of our Eternall Election? Indeed the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they beat down this doctrine. And hence it is that in the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> there was this Canon made, that if any man ſhould ſay he was bound to believe, that he was of the number of them that God hath predeſtinate, or elected to life, let him be an accurſed man. They did endeavour to beat down aſſurance, and held, that all that a man could have, muſt be onely a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturall aſſurance, or ſome kinde of hopes of ſalvation, and no other. Now that you might not erre in this point, ſee what the Scripture ſpeaks in this caſe. That though Election be an act of God from eternity, yet a believer may firmly and fully know his own election: And this I ſhall make good by ſeverall places of Scripture. Read <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. <hi>Rejoyce not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>that you have power to caſt out
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115140:96"/>divels, that they are ſubject to you, but rejoyce rather in this, that your names are written in the book of life.</hi> That is, rejoyce not, that you can work miracles; that wicked men can doe, that are not elected; but rather rejoyce, that your names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of life; that is, that in Gods decree you are elected to ſalvation. Now, how could they rejoyce, unleſſe they knew this? So, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Knowing brethren, beloved, your election of God.</hi> The Apoſtle takes it for granted, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers did know they were elected. So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. <hi>The Lord hath bleſſed us with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he hath choſen us in him, before the ſoundation of the world was, having predeſtinated us to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Many more Scriptures I might urge, but in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, it is enough to confirme every truth.</p>
               <p>But now though the Scripture be thus cleare; yet there are ſome objections, that ſeemingly oppoſe this truth, which I muſt ſatisfie. The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as farre as I have read in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, I finde five objections, they draw from Scripture againſt this truth, that a man may be aſſured of his Election: for, ſay they, it was an act of Gods, done before we had a being, and how can we be aſſured of that? I will therefore, beloved, firſt produce thoſe Scriptures that they pretend wil overthrow this point, and then take off what ſeems to make againſt it. The firſt Text they urge is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Paſſe the time of your ſojourning here in feare.</hi> This Scripture (ſay they) bids us paſſe our time in feare; and if ſo, then we cannot be aſſured of our election, but we muſt feare all the daies of our life, whether we are elected or no.</p>
               <p>To this I ſhall anſwer briefly. You muſt know the feare that the holy Ghoſt here preſſeth, that men ſhould paſſe their time in feare, is not meant of a feare about our election; but it is meant of a feare of ſinne; that we muſt not ſinne againſt God, but feare God, and feare to provoke God by our ſinne. And if you ask how this appeares, I make it appeare plainly thus; for verſ. 18. it is ſaid, <hi>Knowing beloved, that you are not redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, but with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115140:96"/>blood of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Now this verſe proves clearly, that they knew they were redeemed by Chriſts bloud, and ſo by conſequence knew their election. Therefore the Apoſtle did not preſſe a feare, to beat down the knowledge of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but, <hi>paſſe your time in feare, i. e.</hi> feare to offend God, and feare to ſinne againſt him.</p>
               <p>Another objection they urge is this. The Scripture, ſay they doth often commend feare to us; and ſurely feare and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance cannot ſtand together. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwaies.</hi> Now, if a man muſt alwaies feare, then the moſt a man can have is hope; and ſo hang between hope and feare all our daies. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>That the fearing alwaies, which <hi>Salomon</hi> annexed bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto, is not meant of the feare about a mans election, but onely a feare to ſinne againſt God. And if you ask me how that appeares, read the whole verſe, <hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d is the man that feareth alwaies, but he that hardens his heart ſhall runne into miſchiefe.</hi> Now mark, by the Antitheſis it is apparent, that feare there, is not a feare of our everlaſting eſtate, but onely a feare in oppoſition to hardneſſe of heart in wicked men, that goe on in a courſe of ſin.</p>
               <p>Another place they urge is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Wherefore let him that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Now, ſay they, the Scripture tells us, that every man, though never ſo firm, as he thinks, about his election; yet he muſt take heed, he may fall from grace, and be damned for all this. Now by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, I would lay down two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of men that have a grounded aſſurance of their election; but to men that lie in carnall ſecurity, and have deluded perſwaſions of their good eſtate; and this appeares by the Text; for he ſaith, <hi>let him that</hi> thinks <hi>he ſtands.</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>let him that ſtands;</hi> for he cannot fall, but <hi>he that thinks he ſtands.</hi> Thoſe men that nouriſh preſumptuous, and ungrounded perſwaſions, that they are in a good eſtate, and in a happy condition, let them take heed, leſt they fall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the falling here is not meant a falling away from
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115140:97"/>grace, or a falling away finally after election, for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; but it is onely meant of a falling into ſinne: and ſo the meaning is this, <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtands,</hi> i. e. that thinks he is ſtrong in grace, and ſtands upon his own legs, let that man take heed leſt he fall into ſinne. Now a man may take heed of falling into ſinne, yet no way queſtion his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And if you aske how I make it appeare that this is the intendment and ſcope of the place; I anſwer, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. Read the foregoing verſe, <hi>Let not us tempt Chriſt, as they tempted him; let not us murmur, as ſome of them murmured, for theſe things hapned to them for enſamples, and are written for our admonition. Therefore let him that thinketh he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, you have here ſeen ſome men fall into ſinne, you have heard ſome men murmur, ſome men tempt Chriſt; this ſhould make you affraid, leſt you fall into ſinne, and ſuffer the puniſhment they did. But what is this to the denying of aſſurance, that men cannot be aſſured of their election?</p>
               <p>Another place they urge alſo, is <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. <hi>worke out your ſalvation with feare and trembling.</hi> Now ſay they, if a man muſt work out, and carry on the buſineſſe of his ſalvation with feare and trembling, then ſurely a man can never be aſſured in this life of his election. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>That feare and trembling there ſpoken of, is not a feare and trembling in oppoſition to the aſſurance of our election; but in oppoſition to that carnall ſecurity, and ſinfull dependance upon our own ſtrength; This is apparent in the next words, <hi>For it is God that worketh in you the will and the deed:</hi> And therefore, becauſe you have no ſtrength of your own, and no power of your own to doe any thing, therefore feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in that regard.</p>
               <p>Secondly, feare and trembling may very well be conſiſtent with this grace of aſſurance; for we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord with trembling.</hi> You may feare, and yet rejoyce alſo. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.7. <hi>As for me, I will come into thy houſe in the multitude of thy mercies, and in thy feare I will worſhip towards thine holy Temple.</hi> Here is feare, and confidence in the mercies
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115140:97"/>of God joyned together; to ſhew, that feare and aſſurance may very well be conſiſtent each with other. But then they object, how can this be? for <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>perfect love caſteth out feare.</hi> I anſwer, that though <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>perfect love caſteth out feare;</hi> yet <hi>John</hi> doth not ſay, that imperfect love caſteth out feare. Now in this life our love is imperfect, and therefore mixt with feare; but in heaven our love is perfect, and ſo caſts out all feare. So that ſtill this makes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, but that a man may have a grounded aſſurance of his eternall election.</p>
               <p>Another place they object is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Be not high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but feare.</hi> To this I anſwer: Theſe words are not ſpoken of fearing our election; that we ſhould feare whether we are elected or no. But ſerves to beate down any opinion of our own righteouſneſſe, as if we were therefore accepted of God; and to keep us from inſulting over the rejected Jewes; now that we are taken in, in their room.</p>
               <p>One Scripture more (whch indeed is the main pillar they reſt upon) is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.34. <hi>Who hath known the minde of the Lord? or who hath been his Counſellor?</hi> Here, ſay the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the Scripture challengeth any man in the world to come forth, and ſay, that he knowes Gods mind; by Gods mind is meant Gods decree. And here <hi>Paul</hi> challengeth all, that no man knows the decree of God from eternity. Therefore, if no man knows the mind of God, then certainly none know their own election, for that is Gods mind, and Gods decree: this they hold an undeniable argument.</p>
               <p>And here to ſatisfie you in this Scripture, I ſhall lay down three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When it is ſaid, <hi>No man knows the mind of God; nor no man is his Counſellor:</hi> this doth hold true, that no man knows the mind or decree of the Lord, touching other mens election. The Apoſtle doth not ſpeak this, as if no man knew Gods minde about his own, but about other mens election, who are elected, and who are not; for that is the ſcope of the place. The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they thought all the <hi>Jewes</hi> were damned men; and they cenſured and vaunted over them. Now, ſaith
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115140:98"/>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> None knows Gods mind concerning others, whether they ſhall be ſaved or damned, while they are in this world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, no man knows the mind of the Lord in this ſenſe, that is, ſo as to give a reaſon of Gods decree; why God did decree this, and decree that; why God did chuſe <hi>Peter,</hi> and not elect <hi>Judas;</hi> no man knows the reaſon of Gods decree, and of his waies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, No man knows the mind of the Lord, that is, no man knows Gods decree, by looking upon it alone; but by bringing down Gods ſecret will to his revealed will; and ſo we may know his decree. I may make uſe of that place <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Let no man ſay, I will aſcend up to heaven to fetch Chriſt thence; but what ſaith the word? the word is night thee, even in thy mouth.</hi> Truſt to that. As if he ſhould ſay, Let no man think to know Gods decrees, by going into heaven, and there ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching into Gods decrees, for that he cannot doe; but look upon the word, and there he ſhall finde whom God hath ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and decreed to ſave, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. No man can know by looking barely upon the decree; but if we compare Gods decree with his word, and from the word look upon them that are elected, we may eaſily know whether we are elected or no. Which puts me upon the third head premiſed, How a man may be aſſured in his own ſoule, that he is elected to life and ſalvation by God the Father.</p>

                  </bibl>
                  <q>Wherefore the rather, Brethren, give all diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN the proſecution of this ſubject, you may remember, the laſt Doctrine I drew forth was this, <hi>That Chriſtians ſhould put forth a great deale of diligence to make this ſure to their ſoules, that they are eternally elected by God the Father.</hi> In the handling of which, I have ſhewn you, 1. what election is. 2. That the people of God may make ſure their own election, though done from all eternity.</p>
               <p>I come now to ſhew you, how the people of God may be aſſured in their own hearts that they are eternally elected. And here, to compaſſe this knowledge or aſſurance of our election, I doe not onely carry it ſo farre as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> doe, that ſay, you may have a perſwaſion, which they call, <hi>fides conjecturalis,</hi> a conjecturall faith, or hope you may be ſaved; but will not come up ſo farre as the words of my Text, to be ſure of it. Now ſhould a man uſe no more then the words of the Text, in that it is preſſed as a command, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it may be made ſure to a mans own ſelfe. For no man is bound to an impoſſible thing;
<note place="margin">Nemo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netur ad impoſſibile.</note> and in that it is a thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to be aſſured of our election, the Scripture would never oblige our obedience to that which is impoſſible in it ſelfe. I doe not drive ſo farre onely, but further. What ſhould an elect man doe to be certainly perſwaded that he is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally elected by God to obtain life and ſalvation. I am now handling a doctrine to be trembled at, while you are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it. And in the reſolving of this query, you muſt take this rule; that you cannot get aſſumnce by aſcending into
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115140:99"/>Gods decree, but by deſcending into your own hearts, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them by the word, whether thoſe ſaving effects, which God doth work in an elect perſon, be wrought in your ſoules or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: and that is the way to come to a ſure and certain knowledge of your election. The knowledge of your election is not attainable by aſcending into Gods decree; <hi>for who hath made you his Counſellors.</hi> Nor is it enjoyned you by way of Revelation. That is an unſure ground, and you may runne into Enthuſiaſme, as well as perſwaſion about your election. It is not done by Revelation, neither againſt nor without the word. What ever teſtimony there is, if it come not from the word, you may ſuſpect it to be a deluſion. Now the ſafeſt way, (though I know much cried down) for you to goe by, in ſearching whether you are in the number of Gods elect, is to ſearch into your own hearts, whether thoſe things be wrought in you, which are wrought in thoſe whom God hath elected to life and ſalvation. And here I ſhall content my ſelfe with the naming of ſix ſaving effects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, every man that is elected, ſooner or latter, ſhall be effectually called, and ſavingly converted by the power of the word. This the Apoſtle laies down, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Knowing brethren, beloved, your election of God.</hi> How ſhould this be known? Verſ. 5. <hi>For our word came not to you in word onely, but in power, and in the holy Ghoſt:</hi> that is, our Goſpel did not come in word onely, to affect your eares, and reſt there; but our word came with power, being backt with the operation of the Spirit, for your converſion. This work all men that are elected, ſooner or latter muſt come under, to have the power of the word come with authority upon Conſcience, for his effectuall calling. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he predeſtinated, whom he appointed to life, them he called.</hi> And therefore, Beloved, who ever you are, if you live and die without having the power of the Word to paſſe upon your ſoule, for your effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall Calling, you may lay your hearts under this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that you are not elected by God to obtaine life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For, <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinated, them he calls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, a man that is elected by God to life, ſooner or
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115140:99"/>latter God will ſanctifie him by renewing and regenerating grace: And this is onely different from the former in degree; for calling is ſanctification begun. Now when God elects a man, he doth not onely begin the work of grace, but he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it on in a courſe of ſanctification. And of this you read 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>We are bold to give thanks to God alwaies for you, beloved of the Lord, becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and beliefe of the truth.</hi> If God hath from the beginning choſen a man to ſalvation, the Lord doth it through ſanctification; not for ſanctification, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, or for faith forſeen, but it is through it, as a means whereby we are brought to ſalvation; ſanctification ſhall runne through your lives, as water through a channel. So, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. They that are <hi>elected according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by Chriſt, through ſanctification.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. And therefore beloved, if men live and die, and have not the power of ſanctifying grace upon their hearts and conſciences, and working in their lives, doubtleſſe thoſe men are not elected; becauſe this you ſee clearly, that at one time or other God will work this in ſuch men. <hi>Jude</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, men elected by God to life and ſalvation ſhall ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or latter be brought into a ſtate of believing, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternall life believed.</hi> No man that is ordained to eternall life, but ſhall be brought to a believing eſtate. And therefore men living and dying in a ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, are not elected. Hence you read, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. it is called, <hi>the faith of Gods elect;</hi> implying, that all that are elected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they die ſhall have faith; and none ſhall have faith, but onely they; and therefore in a peculiar manner called <hi>the faith of Gods elect,</hi> appropriated onely to them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That man that is elected, ſooner, or latter before he dies, God will work in his heart a ſpeciall delight in, and an intire love to the word preached. This you have expreſſed, <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods word; therefore ye are not of God, becauſe you heare not his words.</hi> To be of God, that is, to belong to God by election. Now, he that is of God,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115140:100"/>God will in time make him heare his Word with delight and love; but he that takes no delight therein, is not elected of God. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.5, 6.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Lord will ſooner or latter work in the heart of an elect man, love to the people of God, and compaſſion to thoſe who are not the elect and choſen ones of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Put on as the elect of God, bowels of mercy and loving kindneſs.</hi> The Apoſtle there by the manner of phraſe doth ſeem to intimate thus much, <hi>Put on as the elect of God, &amp;c.</hi> As if it were a thing ordained to, and inſeparable from an elect man, after his effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling, that he ſhould have bowels of mercy towards thoſe that are not called, and that he ſhould have loving kindneſſe towards thoſe that are called. For a man that is once elected, and hath the execution of that decree in effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all calling, it is proper to him to have bowels of mercy.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, God will ſooner or latter work an elect man into a new courſe of living, and of obedience, from what he had in times paſt. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>You are elected according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God through ſanctification to obedience;</hi> that though you were diſobedient before, ſerving divers luſts, yet God, if he hath choſen you, will bring you into a courſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>He hath predeſtinated us.</hi> What to doe? <hi>that we might be conformable to the image of his Sonne.</hi> God intends, that that perſon whom he chooſeth to life, ſhould be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Jeſus Chriſt, and that he ſhall live another manner of life then before; that though he hath formerly been ſubject to ſinne and Satan, yet then he ſhall walk in waies of obedience to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus having briefly finiſht theſe heads, I have onely foure or five cautions to lay down, to bound what hath been ſaid within the limits of truth. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Take notice, that theſe ſix effects doe not extend to children who die while they are children, but to men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are grown to yeers. A child that cannot act reaſon, as he is a child, cannot have any of theſe particulars wrought in him, at leaſt in that way and manner men of yeeres have. A child, as it is an infant, hath not converſion in that way a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115140:100"/>man hath, though it hath ſomewhat equivalent to it; as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like ſanctification, and ſomewhat like that faith men of yeeres have; but what that is, and how wrought, man cannot determine. In preſſing of this therefore, I ſay, it doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to children who die in their infancy, but onely to men come to yeeres of diſcretion, if they live and die without the having of theſe ſix effects, they may conclude, they cannot be elected.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the want of theſe ſix particulars for a time, is no Argument of a mans non-election: for before conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (which is Gods firſt dealing with a ſinner) an elect man may be as vile, and as bad as any wicked man alive. As the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.3. <hi>In times paſt we were alſo diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and ſerved divers luſts, and lived in pleaſure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, &amp;c.</hi> So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. So that the want of this for a time, is no argument of a mans non-election, for then it would follow, a man unconverted is no elect man, which would croſſe the whole tenour of Scripture: But a man living and dying without theſe, doth not belong to the election of grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I doe not preſſe the having of theſe effects actually, if you have them habitually. My meaning is this: A man may be elected, and yet may not act any thing anſwerable to effectuall calling, nor act with any delight and love to the word, nor act any thing in a way of ſanctification; yet, if you have theſe habitually, in the habit of them, theſe may be teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or evidences of election.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I doe not preſſe the having of theſe effects ſenſibly to be an evidence of election, if ſo be you have them really. There are many men have theſe really, when they have them not in their own apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I doe not preſſe the having of theſe effects gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſo you have them ſincerely. My meaning is this, that a man may be elected; yea, and he may not onely be choſen in Gods eternall decree, but the execution of that decree may be paſſed upon him, that he may be effectually called, and yet he may not have all theſe ſix effects in a great meaſure, in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115140:101"/>the higheſt degree, yet he may have them ſincerely, and ſo be a pledge to his own heart of his eternall election.</p>
               <p>And thus having finiſhed this third Query, I come now to enter upon another, depending upon the former; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a very dreadfull ſubject, and a point to be trembled at, while it is handling, and that is this: what probable gueſſe may be given of a man, that he is not within the compaſſe of Gods election? This is a very high point, and muſt be handled with a great deale of ſeriouſneſſe, and ſadneſſe; it being a point concerning the ſalvation or damnation of all the men upon earth. And therfore I would intreat you to look about you. Gods decrees they are in Heaven, and it is onely a reall work of grace upon your hearts on earth, that can give you evidence that thoſe decrees are for good to you. As good wrought is an evidence of Gods purpoſe to ſave you; ſo the contrary work may be an evidence of Gods purpoſe never to ſave you, but of leaving you without the compaſſe of his eternall election. There can be nothing laid down abſolutely and certainly, yet there may be many probable gueſſes given of the men that are not within the compaſſe of Gods election: Of which I ſhall name but ſix or ſeven ſorts. And I wiſh to God, that none of you that are before the Lord this day, have your names written in this black book, leſt you have juſt cauſe to feare your names are not written in the booke of life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That man that fals back from a courſe of profeſſion to a courſe of prophaneneſſe, without timely returning; the Scripture gives a ſhrewd gueſſe of ſuch a man, that he is not within the compaſſe of Gods purpoſe to ſave. I doe not ſay, every backſliding, and every decaying affection, but a totall and finall relapſe; when a man falls, and riſeth not againe; when a man runs from God, and returns not again; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives a gueſſe at him, that he is not within the compaſſe of Gods election. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38, 39. <hi>If any man draw back, my ſoule ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Interpreters obſerve, that in theſe words there is a figure, wherein there is leſſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then is intended, <hi>My ſoule ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:115140:101"/>It is as much as if God ſhould have ſaid, My ſoule ſhall hate, or I will exceedingly hate him. <hi>But we are not of them that draw back to perdition; but of them that believe, to the ſaving of their ſoules:</hi> which words clearly import, that men that draw back without returning, they draw back to perdition, to damnation; but we are not of them, ſaith the Apoſtle. And here then, beloved, doth this word fall upon any man before God this day? Haſt thou left a courſe of ſtrictneſſe, and fallen into a courſe of prophaneneſſe and looſeneſſe? Haſt thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from thy God, and never thinkeſt of a returning? I ſhall not cenſure thee now, but if thou liveſt and dieſt in this eſtate, it is an undoubted argument, thou art not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of Gods decree to ſave.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Men that doe make the mercies and goodneſſe of God as arguments to embolden them the more in ſinne, ſuch men are not likely to be the perſons whom God hath elected to life and glory. In the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> v. 4. It is ſpoken there of <hi>men, that turned the grace of God into wantonneſſe.</hi> And what ſaith the Apoſtle of them, <hi>they are men that are ordained of old to condemnation.</hi> The Scripture there makes it the badge of a man ordained of old to condemnation, when he ſhal perſiſt in this ſinfull temper, to turn Gods grace into laſciviouſneſſe; that is, to take arguments from the grace, and mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, to walk in waies of ſinne. And therefore look to it, and with your hearts bewaile it, all you that are apt to abuſe doctrines of grace; and becauſe God is good, you will be evil; becauſe God is mercifull, therefore you will be ſinful; if you die in this temper, the Scripture declares, that you are the men ordained of old to condemnation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a man that doth walk in a courſe of ſinne, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with malice, and knowingly againſt conſcience, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately without reluctancy; and perſiſt in this, and live and die thus, that man is not within the compaſſe of Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. There is a phraſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.5. <hi>Be not mercifull, O Lord, unto wicked tranſgreſſors.</hi> It is in ſome tranſlations, <hi>Be not mercifull to them that ſinne of wicked malice,</hi> or <hi>of malicious wickedneſſe.</hi> Now there is this rule which Divines give; that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115140:102"/>thoſe prayers which were made by <hi>David,</hi> they are rather Prophecies of what ſhould be, then meere prayers that this might be. As <hi>David</hi> prayed againſt the Jewes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. <hi>that their table might be a ſnare to them, and that they ſhould alway bow down under their burden:</hi> which was a prophecie, and they did ſo. And ſo he prayes here, that God <hi>would not be mercifull to men that ſinne of wicked malice;</hi> which is as much as a prophecie, that God will not be mercifull to men that ſinne of malicious wickedneſſe. And therefore, beloved, all you that ſo live, and reſolve you will die, and haply doe die; who ſinne obſtinately, that, let God command what he can, you will do what you pleaſe; let the Miniſter ſay what he will, you will doe as you liſt; that ſinne againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and againſt conſcience, and without any reluctancy, reſolve to live and die in a courſe of ſinne: the Lord be mercifull to ſuch perſons; for certainly there muſt be no Bible, if ſuch men fall within the compaſſe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That man that by living under the powerfull Miniſtry of the Word, is more hard in heart, and worſe in life; if a man grows thus, it is an argument, he is not within the purpoſe of Gods election. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.14, 15. <hi>By hearing, you ſhall heare, but not underſtand; by ſeeing, you ſhall ſee, but not perceive; this peoples heart is waxed groſſe, their eares dull in hearing, their eyes ſhut, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, heare with their eares, underſtand with their hearts, and be converted, and I ſhould ſave them.</hi> Here is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God laies upon ſuch ſinners, that they ſhall have eyes, and not ſee, they ſhall be ignorant, their hearts ſhall waxe groſſe, they ſhall be uncapable of taking any impreſſion of the word upon them. And what's the end of all this? leſt they ſhould be converted, and I ſhould ſave them; implying, that if God lets you that live under the Miniſtry, to have dark eyes, and hard hearts, it is an argument God hath no intent to ſave you, and therefore his purpoſe is to condemne you. So <hi>John</hi> 12.40. <hi>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their hearts, leſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and underſtand with their hearts and be converted.</hi> Here it is laid down as an act of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115140:102"/>Gods, that God did harden their hearts, and God did blind their eyes, leſt they ſhould be converted; Implying, that if men doe live and die, in this temper, that they have lived yeere after yeere under a powerfull Miniſtry, and yet they grow more blind in judgement, and more profane in life, and more hard in heart, after 20, 30, 40 yeeres hearing, then they were before; that the word doth but draw out their wickedneſſe, and makes them more prophane, and more to oppoſe godlineſſe; the Lord have mercy upon ſuch ſoules, for certainly if God leave you thus, it is an argument he never intends to ſave you; for the Lord doth thus with ſuch, that they might not be ſaved. There is a paſſage <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeks for, but the election hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the reſt were hardned.</hi> By election is meant the elected, (the Abſtract put for the Concrete.) As often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Circumciſion put for Circumciſed; and ſo here, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction put for elected, <hi>The elected have obtained it:</hi> what did they obtaine? they obtained ſalvation and glory; <hi>but the reſt,</hi> that were not elected, <hi>they were hardned.</hi> The Lord there makes it the badge of them that are not elected, that they are a blinded people, and a hardned people. Intimating, that men that are not elected, they ſhall live under the word, yet ſhall be blind in mind, ſhall be hard in heart, ſhall be wicked in life, and the Miniſtry of the word ſhall never reforme them. And if any of you be ſuch, O that the Lord would make you tremble this day, tremble leſt you are not in Gods thoughts, to doe you any good another day.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, when God doth give up men to ſtrong deluſions, not onely to believe lies themſelves, but to teach lies to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce others, when the Lord leaves men to live and die in that eſtate, the Scripture makes it an argument of them that are not choſen by God to life and glory. You ſhall read there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that great deluſion of Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>God gave them up to ſtrong deluſions, to believe lies, that all might be damned, that believe not the truth?</hi> It is made a brand of damnation, when God ſhall give them over to believe lies. Though a godly man may die in a corrupt opinion, for every
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115140:103"/>errour is not a badge of damnation; but errours that are fundamentall, that ſtrike at the foundation of Religion, wherein men runne ſo far, as never to repent of their errour; that, the Scripture makes the badge of a man, whoſe ſoule is in a world of danger. Read that Text, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>There were falſe Prophets among the people, like as there ſhall be falſe Teachers among you.</hi> And who are they? verſ. 2. <hi>They ſhall deny the Lord that bought them, they ſhall bring in damnable hereſies.</hi> (Every errour is not a hereſie,) but theſe men ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, <hi>and many ſhall follow their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious waies.</hi> Now what is their cenſure? <hi>whoſe judgement now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation ſlumbers not.</hi> Their damnation was not aſleep, but for a long time damnation did attend them, and they were in danger of it. So that, beloved, it is great danger for men to be patrons of errour, eſpecially when they are groſſe and palpable; and when in Scripture language they may be called damnable hereſies. It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if men live and die thus, that they are not within the purpoſe of Gods Counſell to doe them good.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Men that live and die in a continuall ſpurning and oppoſition againſt the Goſpell, and word of God powerfully preached, it is a dreadfull ſigne they are not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of Gods election. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>You are not of God, for you heare not his words.</hi> So <hi>John.</hi> 12. <hi>He that heareth the word, is of God, but you heare not his word, therefore you are not of God.</hi> Therefore you belong not to him. But more pregnant to this purpoſe, is that place, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46, 47, 48. <hi>It was neceſſary the word of the Lord ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you, but ſeeing you put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> Now compare this with Verſ. 48. <hi>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternall life, believed.</hi> The oppoſition lies thus: As many as God purpoſed to ſave, they glorified God for his word, and they rejoyced, and were glad in his word: but thoſe that were not decreed to ſalvation, they put off from them the word of the Lord, they ſpurned at it, and oppoſed it, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115140:103"/>could not indure the word of the Lord. Therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>The Jewes ſtirred up the devout and honourable women, and they raiſed up perſecution againſt Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coaſt.</hi> It was ſaid to <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 25.16. <hi>By this I know, that the Lord hath purpoſed to deſtroy thee, becauſe thou haſt not hearkned to my counſell.</hi> Thus you ſee, the Scripture makes it the badge of a man, that doth not fall within the compaſſe of Gods election, to bring him to life and glory, to live and die in oppoſition to the word of God.</p>
               <p>Sevently, and this we may ſpeake more confidently and poſitively, that that man is not within the compaſſe of Gods election, who ſinnes the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. <hi>He ſhall neither be forgiven in this life, nor in the life to come.</hi> This is an unpardonable ſinne, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. Now I know there are many men, who confine this ſinne onely to the Phariſees, as if they onely were guilty of it. There are others, that ſay this ſinne is ſeldome committed; and ſo many Divines ſpeak favourably of it: but, Beloved, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, this ſinne is oftner committed, then moſt men in the world dream of; and many men are plunged into this ſinne, that think well of their own ſoules. The ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, is onely this.</p>
               <p>It is a wilfull and deliberate act in a profeſſor of Religion, whereby he doth not onely fall from his profeſſion; but he runnes into a courſe of ſinne knowingly, againſt conſcience; obſtinately, againſt counſell; and maliciouſly, againſt Jeſus Chriſt. This is briefly a deſcription of this ſinne. Now I am perſwaded there are many in the world that have profeſſed Religion, that are, if not in this ſinne, yet at the very next doore to it. And if a man be gone thus farre, this is called in Scripture, <hi>a ſinne unto death;</hi> a ſinne, which if a man fall into, he may be ſure he ſhall be damned. And thus I have in briefe given you an account of theſe ſeven particulars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every man may give a gueſſe in his own thoughts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be within the purpoſe of Gods election to ſalvation, or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:115140:104"/>I have now, from this ſad Doctrine, onely a few comfortable poſitions to lay down, and ſo conclude. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though theſe particulars may give you a gueſſe of thoſe that are not within the compaſſe of Gods election, yet no man is bound to make this ſure to himſelfe, that he is not elected. You are bound to make your election ſure, but you are not bound to make your reprobation ſure. For theſe heads I have given out, not to make any godly man queſtion his election, but to ſtartle wicked men, who live quite contrary, and oppoſite to the elect of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That a man may come very nigh to the worſt of theſe ſins, and yet may be an elect man. <hi>We were</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>ſometimes diſobedient, deceived, and ſerved divers luſts.</hi> Titus 3.3. And Epheſ. 2.2. <hi>In times paſt you walked according to the courſe of the world, according to the power of the Prince of the aire, who worketh mightily in the children of diſobedience.</hi> In times paſt you were children of wrath, as well as others. In times paſt before calling, you may come very neere to theſe evils, yet be within the compaſſe of Gods election, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you doe not live and die in thoſe evils. For if ſo, there is no hope of mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That for men to queſtion their election, meerly becauſe they doe not finde the ſaving effects of election in their hearts and lives, is rather an argument of their being, then of their not being elected. Becauſe men not elected, they never look after their election, to make it ſure, they will truſt all upon the mercy of God, and grace of God, and never look after holineſſe; ſin never troubles them, profaneneſſe never grieves them, want of holineſſe perplexes not them. The queſtioning therefore of your election ariſing from the evils of your converſation, is rather a ſigne that God hath choſen you to life and glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Election it runnes often times to thoſe, that are the worſt ſort of men in the world. Election runnes to them that have been worſt in their lives, before they were called. And thereby God magnifies the riches of his grace. Election paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by civill honeſt men, and ingenious tempered men, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115140:104"/>commonly runs to men, that have been ſcandalous, looſe, Atheiſticall, profane livers, before they were called. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31. <hi>Whores and Harlots ſhall come to Heaven before you. Manaſſeh,</hi> that was a cruell murderer, and Idolater, yet election ran to him. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> a common ſtrumpet, out of whom Chriſt caſt ſeven Divels, yet election ran to her. <hi>Rahab,</hi> a Harlot; <hi>Paul,</hi> a perſecuter, a blaſphemer, a man injurious to the Saints; yet <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15. <hi>He was a choſen veſſell unto God,</hi> and obtained mercy. God, to magnifie the riches of his free grace, lets election run to the worſt of men that are in the world. And this ſhould be great comfort to you; though you have been drunkards, and though you have been Sabbath breakers and adulterers, and though you have been profane, yet if you can but now cloſe in with Jeſus Chriſt, and looke after heaven, if you can but now mourn over your condition, and repent of your former failings, and come in to Jeſus Chriſt; Election hath runne unto men as bad as you, and though you may be now men profane in your lives, yet you may be objects of Gods election.</p>

               <p>THe laſt Doctrine I drew from theſe words, was this, <hi>That Chriſtians ſhould put forth a great deale of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make this ſure to their ſoules, that they are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally elected by God to life and glory.</hi> In the proſecution of which, I have gone over ſome queries. There are four diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties or queries I am further to inſiſt upon in treating of this point. As namely,</p>
               <p>Firſt, whether this election be univerſall, or no?</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether a man that is once elected by God to ſalvation, may come to be damned, yea, or no?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whether God, in electing a man to life and glory, doth it out of any foreſight of faith, or any other grace he ſees in man?</p>
               <p>And fourthly, whether this doctrine of election, that God in his own counſell hath determined, who ſhall be damned, and who ſaved, doth not take men off from any endeavours after their own ſalvation, to make them deſperate, and neglect the uſe of means; that they ſhall ſay, if I ſhall be damned, I ſhall be damned; and if ſaved, I ſhall be ſaved, let me live as I liſt? whether this doctrine will favour this deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, yea, or no?</p>
               <p>Firſt, whether election be univerſall, or no? This is that the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> doe mightily drive at. And here they lay down this concluſion, which they make unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: That there is ſuch a thing as a certain univerſall election of God, without limitation or reſtraint of perſons, whereby
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115140:105"/>God did determine to ſave all mankind by Chriſt, who were fallen in <hi>Adam.</hi> This opinion was firſt drawn from <hi>Origen,</hi> who held that all creatures ſhould be ſaved; and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> mincing the matter, to make it a little more plauſible, then he did, they ſay, that God in his purpoſe did intend to ſave all mankind by Jeſus Chriſt; but man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away, and walking contrary to their principles, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect lies in them, that they are not ſaved: and this Divines call univerſall redemption.</p>
               <p>Now againſt this, I ſhall lay down ſeverall Scriptures, and then take off the objections that ſeems to ſtrengthen this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for Scriptures. In the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ. 3. you read of <hi>ſome that were ordained of old to condemnation.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſure all could not be ſaved. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Some men are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to wrath, but we to obtain ſalvation through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore all men could not be within the purpoſe of Gods firſt intention to ſave. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>The Jewes did not obtaine what they ſought for, but the elect obtained it, and the reſt were hardned.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.20. <hi>There are veſſels of honour, and veſſels of diſhonour.</hi> The Scripture makes it a diſcriminating act in God, that ſome he choſe to life; and others from eternity in his councell he choſe to wrath and condemnation. And theſe Scriptures will fully overthrow this opinion. And indeed the very word <hi>chuſing</hi> confutes it, which intimates a taking of ſome, with an overlooking of others.</p>
               <p>But now let us view a little the Arguments or Scriptures they abuſe, to ſtrengthen this unſound opinion of theirs.</p>
               <p>One is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>As in Adant all died, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> Now, ſay they, Every man did die in <hi>Adam;</hi> every mothers child by <hi>Adams</hi> fall became ſubject to death: even ſo, in Chriſt ſhall every man be made alive; the Lord did intend that every man ſhould have benefit by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now to take off this; I ſhall anſwer it in ſhewing you the true intent and ſcope of this Scripture. This univerſall phraſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115140:106"/>of making alive, hath not reference to the ſaving of the ſoule, but to the reſurrection of the body: And ſo the ſence is this. That as in <hi>Adam,</hi> by vertue of his ſinne, every man came to die a naturall death; So in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive; that is, ſo by Chriſts power ſhall every man riſe from the dead. And if you aske how I make that appeare to be the intendment of the Text. I anſwer, the words themſelves will make it plaine. Verſ. 11. It is ſaid, <hi>By man came death, by man alſo came the reſurrection from the dead:</hi> that is, as by that man <hi>Adam</hi> came death, ſo by that man Chriſt ſhall come the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead: <hi>for as in Adam all died,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that here you ſee, this is brought in as a proofe of the 21. verſe: Intimating, that this being made alive, hath no reference to the life of the ſoule, but onely to the Reſurrection of the body; that as <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſinne brought death to all men, ſo Chriſt by his power ſhall raiſe all men from the dead; <hi>every man in his own order.</hi> However, ſhould this be granted, that this making alive ſhould have reference to the life of the ſoul; it would beare no more but this, that all that are damned, are damned as in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes; and all that are ſaved, ſhall be ſaved as in the loynes of Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo make nothing at all to prove this which they call univerſall election.</p>
               <p>Another Scripture (undeniable they think) is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. where it is ſaid, <hi>God hath concluded all men under unbeliefe, that he might have mercy upon all.</hi> Now ſay they, If God did doe an act to make men ſee their unbeliefe, and did intend by this action to have mercy upon all, then God in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell intended to ſave all.</p>
               <p>Now to this, <hi>that he might have mercy upon all;</hi> I anſwer: This phraſe (<hi>all</hi>) is not to be taken in an unlimited ſence, as if he would have mercy upon all mankind; but it is to be taken in a reſtrained ſence, that <hi>God ſhut up all men in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe;</hi> that is, God made all believers ſee their own miſery; that he might have mercy on all them that believe. And if you ask how I prove this to be the meaning of the Text, I anſwer: The Scripture makes it cleare, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath concluded all men under ſinne.</hi> (The very words fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted.)
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115140:106"/>But what's the limitation? Shall all men be ſaved? No. For mark the next words. <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all men under ſinne, that the promiſe by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be given to them that believe.</hi> Now, though <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay thus to the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet the words being the ſame, the Reſtriction holds good in both places. So that it is clear, <hi>That he might ſave all,</hi> or <hi>have mercy upon all.</hi> It is not meant all univerſally; but all, with this limitation of <hi>Paul</hi> here; all <hi>them that believe.</hi> Again,</p>
               <p>Another objection, or Scripture, they abuſe is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> This Text <hi>Origen</hi> doth groſly abuſe; holding hence, that it is the intendment and will of God, that all men ſhould be ſaved. Now, to take off this objection; We muſt firſt diſtinguiſh here of Gods will, and then of this phraſe, <hi>All. Who will have all men to be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, of Gods will;

               <p>Now the will of Gods good pleaſure is, that reall purpoſe in God to ſave a man. And there is no man that in this ſence God wils to be ſaved, but he muſt be ſaved; but in this ſence God wils not all men to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, there is Gods ſignificative will, that is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in Scripture God tenders ſalvation to every man that will lay hold upon Jeſus Chriſt: and ſo Gods ſignifying will excludes no man from ſalvation; but the Miniſters, if they preach to ten thouſand people, they muſt tender Chriſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to them all, becauſe they know not which of them are elect, and which reprobate; which of them ſhall be ſaved, and which damned. This is Gods ſignifying will, and though God by this will tell you what Miniſters muſt doe, to tender Chriſt and ſalvation to all; yet this doth no way follow, that the determinate will of Gods good pleaſure is involved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, as if all men ſhould be ſaved. <hi>Perkins</hi> in his writings hath this diſtinction of it. That there is Gods abſolute will, and ſo he wils not all men to be ſaved: and Gods condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115140:107"/>will, that in caſe every man did believe, they ſhould be ſaved; for God envies no mans ſalvation; there is grace enough in God, and willingneſſe enough in God, to ſave every man in the world.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, there may be a more diſtinct anſwer given to this place. <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved. All,</hi> is taken ſometimes in a diſtributive ſence, and ſometimes in a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective ſence. In a diſtributive ſence, for every man under heaven; and ſo God wils not all men to be ſaved. But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in a collective ſence; for all ſorts and degrees of men, and ſo God intends to ſave all; that is, ſome of all ſorts, and of all degrees of men in the world. And this appeares if you mark the context. <hi>He will have all men to be ſaved,</hi> that is, ſome of all ſorts. Some Kings, and ſome great men, ſome rich, and ſome poore, ſome Princes, and ſome beggars. And therefore the Apoſtle bids them pray for all men. <hi>Pray,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for Kings, and for them in authority: for God will have all men to be ſaved.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, Pray for Kings, becauſe God of his grace may ſave Kings, as well as poorer men, that have leſſe incumbrances, and leſſe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world, and leſſe withdrawings in their own ſoule, then they have. God will ſave all: ſalvation ſhall come to all ſorts of men, and therefore you may lawfully pray for them. And ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> judiciouſly expounds this place; that God will have all ſorts of men to obtaine ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt: but is not to be extended univerſally, as if every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall man and woman ſhould be ſaved. 3. Theſe words are to be taken with thoſe that follow after, <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Now that God will be willing to ſave thoſe that come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, is unqueſtionable; all that repent, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. all oppoſition to the time of the old Teſtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25.</p>

               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Query is this, Whether may one that is an elect man, fall away from his election, and come to be a damned man, or no? This the Proteſtant Divines againſt the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> have had large controverſies about, but I will not handle it in a controverſall way, onely, as it beſt becomes a Pulpit, ſhew you thoſe poſitive Scriptures and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that may cleare the truth, and then anſwer the ſtrongeſt objections they produce to the contrary.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Q. </seg>
                  </label> Whether may a man that is elected fall away, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward periſh? To this I anſwer. No. A man that is once ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by God can never periſh. And this I ſhall give Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reaſon to plead for it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. Chriſt tels us of errour, that it came in ſo eaſily, <hi>that if it were poſſible, it would deceive the elect.</hi> Intimating, that it is impoſſible ſo to ſeduce the elect, as to make them finally fall away. So, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given me, ſhall come unto me:</hi> that is, all that God the Father hath decreed to ſave by Chriſt, ſhall come unto Chriſt. Verſ. 39. <hi>This is the Fathers will, that hath ſent me, that of all that he hath given me, I ſhould loſe none.</hi> This is the Fathers will, and Commiſſion to Chriſt, that of all thoſe that by his decree he had given to Chriſt to ſave by redemption, he ſhould loſe none. And ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I have loſt nothing.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> 10.28, 29. <hi>I give unto my ſheep eternall life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man take them out of my hands; my Father that gave them me, is greater then all, and no man ſhall pluck them out of my Fathers hands.</hi> By his Fathers hands, he means his decree; God by his decree intended to ſave ſo many, and Chriſt to vindicate his Father, tels us, that ſo many as God the Father had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to ſalvation, neither man nor divell ſhould prevaile to pluck them out of his Fathers hand. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1. <hi>God hath
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115140:108"/>not caſt away his people whom he ſoreknew.</hi> That is, whom God did predeſtinate, he caſts none of them away, none of them ſhall periſh. Many more Scriptures I might multiply, to ſhew, that a man once elected, can never periſh; as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 9. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.3. But I would name reaſons as well as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, if Election were changeable, then God muſt be changeable; which to think, there is nothing more abſurd. If Gods decree be changeable, Gods eſſence and nature were ſo alſo; election being nothing elſe, but God himſelfe chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: for every thing in God, is God. And this the Scripture tels us, is farre from him; for <hi>there is no variableneſſe or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of change in God. Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.10. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the elect could periſh, then Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be very unfaithfull to his father, becauſe God the father hath given this charge to Chriſt, that whomſoever he elected, Chriſt ſhould preſerve them ſafe, to bring them to heaven. Now ſhould not this be accompliſhed, Chriſt would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull to his father. <hi>John</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the fathers will, which hath ſent me into the world, that of all that he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but that I ſhould raiſe them up at the laſt day.</hi> This is the will of God, to ſave many by Chriſt. Now, ſhould not this be made good, Chriſt muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull to the Commiſſion of his father.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſhould this be true, then <hi>Pauls</hi> golden chaine ſhould be broken. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he calls; whom he calls, them he juſtifies; whom he juſtifies, them he glorifies.</hi> Now, ſhould this chain break, that whom he elects, them he calls, whom he calls, them he juſtifies, and there ceaſe (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold) and men be after damned, then the great and many links would be loſt, that whom he juſtifies, them he glorifies, and ſo bring an abſurdity upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereby.</p>
               <p>Now to anſwer ſome texts of Scripture they abuſe, (which at firſt view you would think very plauſible) to maintain, that a man may be an elect man, and brought into Chriſt, yet afterward damned. The firſt is, <hi>John</hi> 6.70. <hi>Have not I choſen
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115140:108"/>twelve, and one of them is a divell?</hi> Now ſay they, there were twelve choſen, or elected, and one of them is a divel, did periſh, intimating, that men may be elected, yet periſh for all this. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>That there is a double electing. Firſt, a chuſing to ſome peculiar Office. Secondly, there is an electing to grace, life, and glory. Now, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Have not I choſen you twelve?</hi> it is meant of his chuſing of them to an Office, to the place of an Apoſtle, to be his diſciples. Now it is true, that man may be choſen to ſome peculiar office in the Church of God, and yet be a periſhing and damned man; but this phraſe hath no relation to the decree of God from eternity, onely to a temporall electing of twelve men to a temporall Office, to the Office of an Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Another Scripture they abuſe is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32. it was <hi>Moſes</hi> prayer, <hi>If thou wilt not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to God) <hi>forgive their ſinnes, then blot my name out of the book of life.</hi> Now, ſay they, <hi>the book of life</hi> is Gods election: and here <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, <hi>that God would blot his name out of the book of life.</hi> Intimating, ſay they, a man may be elected and written in that book, and yet afterward blotted out and periſh?</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer. That this prayer of <hi>Moſes</hi> is onely a wiſh or ſuppoſition, as <hi>Pauls</hi> was, when he wiſht <hi>he were accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from Chriſt, for his kindred in the fleſh.</hi> Now a man may ſuppoſe mountaines of Gold, and ſuppoſe things that never were, nor ever ſhall be in being: bare ſuppoſitions put nothing in being; ſo here, that <hi>Moſes</hi> makes a ſuppoſition in a pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall prayer; this doth no way argue, as if his name could be blotted out of the book of life.</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>Rivet</hi> he expounds it thus, that there is a double book of life. The book of life being ſometimes taken for the eternall counſell and decree of God, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3. ſometimes for the ſpeciall providence of God over men, in preſerving them among the living. So we read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>In thy book,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, were all my members written:</hi> meaning, not in the book of Gods decree, but onely in the book of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that all the members of <hi>Davids</hi> body, they were all
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115140:109"/>under the providence of God, that none could hurt him. And ſo <hi>Rivet,</hi> with others, think that by the book of life here is meant, that God would blot out <hi>Moſes</hi> from the book of his ſpeciall protection, and let him die as other men, rather then this evil ſhould come upon the people of <hi>Iſrael. q. d.</hi> Deſtroy my name from among men, and doe not protect me any longer.</p>
               <p>Againe, they object that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.28. It is ſaid, <hi>Let them be blotted out of the book of life.</hi> Now, ſay they, That is Gods election, and to be blotted out implies, that a man may be elected, and yet periſh.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, as formerly, that the book of life in that place hath no reference to the decree of Gods election, but onely to his book of providence, that God would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect wicked men, as he doth his own people, in a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. And other phraſes in Scripture will ſomewhat fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this interpretation. As <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.9. <hi>They ſhall not be written in the writings of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Whats that? <hi>i.e.</hi> let them not any more be thought Iſraelites, nor numbred among the people. And <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> I remember compares <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.19. with this place in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.9. and he makes the ſence to be one and the ſame; that to be blotted out of the book of life, is nothing elſe, then to be out of Gods protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to be blotted out of the catalogue of the living, and have ones life in danger to be brought to death. And this wiſh <hi>David</hi> wiſhed for thoſe wicked men.</p>
               <p>But then they object further from <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.19. <hi>If any man ſhall take away from the words of this book, God ſhall take away his part in the book of life.</hi> Here, ſay they, by book of life, is unqueſtionably meant, Gods decree; and the Scripture ſaith, <hi>they that take any thing from this booke, God will blot him out of the book of life,</hi> and will undoubtedly damne him.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer. I confeſſe in this place the book of life is taken for Gods decree; and that a man may be ſaid to be blotted out of this book, and yet this no way follow, that a man elected may be damned. And here, let me give you <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> words upon the place, which is a very cleare and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory anſwer. That a man may be ſaid to be blotted out of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115140:109"/>the book of life in two regards: Firſt, it is equivalent to this phraſe, that his name ſhall never be written in the book of life. And you have often ſuch phraſes in Scripture. As it is ſaid in <hi>Matthew. He that doth evill himſelfe, and teacheth men ſo to doe, he ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not as if he ſhould come to heaven, but that he ſhould not come there at all. To be leaſt there, is never to be there. So here, To be blotted out is equivalent to this, that they were never in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a mans name may be ſaid to be blotted out of the book of life, not as if it were there in deed and in truth, but in their own opinion; they thought they were elected, and thought their names were written there, they had ſtrong conceits of this; and though they are now deluded, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, yet God will make them know one day, when they are in hell, that their names are blotted out of the book of life. Again,</p>
               <p>Another Scripture they abuſe is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Now, ſay they, if it were not poſſible for a man elected to fall, and fall finally, to what end is this caution of the Apoſtle? it were a needleſſe caution, were it not poſſible to come to paſſe.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer two things. Firſt, the Apoſtle doth not ſay, Let him that ſtands, take heed leſt, &amp;c. but the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that men that think they are elected, and think they are in a good condition, they ſhould take heed, leſt they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed leſt they fall.</hi> This falling here is not meant, a falling from grace finally, and falling into hell, and periſhing; but the falling here is onely a falling into ſinne, and ſo an elect man ſhould doe. An elect man, though he ſtand firm in Gods decree, yet he ſhould take heed all the daies of his life, that he fall not into ſinne. And if you aske me, how I make that appeare, I anſwer, from the context. This is a concluſion, or caution the Apoſtle gives upon the enumeration of ſeverall inſtances of the people of God, that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115140:110"/>in former ages did ſinne againſt God. <hi>As ſome that tempted Chriſt, and ſell in one day</hi> 23000. <hi>Others that fell to fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and provoked him in the wilderneſſe.</hi> With many ſuch ſins reckoned up, and the ſumme of all is this, that ſeeing they that were Gods people fell into ſinne, and were puniſhed, therefore you that think you ſtand, and think you are elected, you ſhould take heed you fall not into ſinne, as they did. And thus I have done with reſolving this ſecond query.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whether doth God elect any man to life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon foreſight of his faith or good works? foreſeeing that this man will believe, therefore I elect him to ſalvation; and the other man doth not believe, therefore I chuſe him to damnation. Whether, I ſay, doth God in his eternall decree elect any man to life, upon foreſight of works. Here the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> joyne both together in maintaining of this. The reaſon, ſay they, why God elects ſome, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is becauſe God did foreſee from eternity that that man would be holy, and would believe in Chriſt, and therefore God elected him to ſalvation. Theſe are the hard imputations they lay to Gods charge.</p>
               <p>And in the reſolving of this, I ſhall anſwer it in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. That God, in electing a certain number of men to life and ſalvation, did not doe it upon the foreſight of any good works he ſaw would be in them; whether Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſanctification, or any other grace. Indeed it is true, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> many of them doe not groſly ſay, that it was foreſight of good works in generall, but the foreſight of faith only, and ſo the <hi>Arminians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, to overthrow this ungrounded opinion, Firſt, I ſhall lay down Scriptures to confirm this, that God in electing of men to ſalvation, doth not doe it upon foreſight of good workes, and then lay down reaſons; and after that take thoſe objections, which ſeem to darken this truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the Scriptures that confirm this, we have <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>He hath ſaved a remnant according to the election of grace.</hi> Intimating, that the remnant that are ſaved, it is onely of grace, not of foreſeen works. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 11. <hi>He hath elected
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115140:110"/>us according to the good pleaſure of his own will.</hi> Gods meere good will was the impulſive cauſe of mans election, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in man. So likewiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>That Gods election might ſtand, not according to our works, but according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of him that called us.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Not of works, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own purpoſe and grace.</hi> Upon his good pleaſure, and his good will to mankind, upon that ground election ſtands.</p>
               <p>But now to adde ſome reaſons, why it cannot be that God ſhould determine in his own counſell, to ſave man upon the foreſight of his works. I ſhall name three or foure. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the inferiour priviledges that God beſtows upon his people, as vocation, and juſtification (though they are in actuall being) are not for their good works, therefore much leſſe is election for good works onely foreſeen. Firſt, for Vocation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We are called, not according to our own works, but according to the purpoſe of his own grace.</hi> And then for juſtification, we are not juſtified for works neither. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.34. <hi>We are juſtified freely by his grace, for by the works of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi> Now, if vocation and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication be not for works, much leſſe is election for works, and for works foreſeen, not in being in us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe then it would follow, that children, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in infancy could not be elected<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for the child being in the mothers wombe, if it hath life, it hath a ſoule, and ſo muſt either be ſaved, or damned. But a child, while it is in the womb, neither acts good or evill. Now if God did elect perſons to life, upon foreſight of works, then children dying in the wombe could not be elected; becauſe there are no works God could foreſee in them. And then this would be a very uncomfortable doctrine for parents, that have children dying young.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, then would man have ſomewhat whereof to boaſt before his God, as if he could lay claime to ſalvation from him. If God were bound to chooſe men to ſalvation upon foreſight of good works, then man might ſay, I thank not God, but I thank my believing, and thank my good works,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115140:111"/>for theſe were the motives for which he choſe me to glory; and thus would poore man boaſt againſt his Maker.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe God hath elected the worſt of men; when others that have more naturall worth and goodneſſe are paſſed by. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28. <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the weake things of the world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and baſe things of the world, and things that are deſpiſed hath God choſen, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes.</hi> Thoſe that had the greateſt worldly wiſdome, and naturall abilities, that moſt excelled in outward ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and morall vertues, are rejected, when thoſe that are but babes in underſtanding, who many times are the worſt for their moralities, are elected; which is a cleare demonſtration, that election is not grounded upon faith, or works foreſeen; for then the beſt had been choſen before the reſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Our works carry no proportion to what God hath elected us unto; we are elected to eternall glory, but our works are finite, imperfect, no more then our duty; yea not done by our own ſtrength, but by the power of Gods grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be that which moveth God to elect us.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, becauſe God doth not chuſe men to life for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, therefore much leſſe for their works ſake.</p>
               <p>It is true, and miſtake me not, I confeſſe, (and ſo all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that are confeſſe this) that God ſaves a man for Chriſts ſake, but God elects not a man for Chriſts ſake, but meerly for his own good pleaſures ſake. God in chuſing a man to life, hath no reference to Chriſt, as if Chriſt were the motive. Chriſt was predeſtinated himſelfe, therefore could not be the cauſe of our predeſtination, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. We are choſen in him its true, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. as the common perſon; God elected Chriſt firſt in order, and all believers in him, but it is not for Chriſts ſake, but according to his own will. As ſuppoſe a Kingdome to be newly ſet up, a King is choſen, and his ſucceſſors to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after; why then all the ſucceeding Kings are choſen in him that was firſt elected: ſo are we choſen in Chriſt. God
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115140:111"/>doth chuſe a man as freely, as if Chriſt did never die; and yet God ſaves none, but for Chriſts ſaxe; and this makes election on Gods part moſt free. God doth not conſider Chriſt, nor the good works we have, but tis onely his own good will engages him to ſave ſome, and neglect others. And thus much for proving this point. There are ſome objections now that lie in the way, which muſt be removed.</p>
               <p>God, ſay they, doth elect men upon the foreſight of their good works; and they alledge foure Scriptures to prove this. <hi>James</hi> 2.2 <hi>Hath not God choſen the poore of this world to be rich in faith?</hi> now, ſay they, their laying out their eſtates for good uſes, and ſo becomming poore, that is the reaſon why God chuſeth them, and neglects richer men.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer. That poore here is onely ſpoken of,

And this anſwer Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> gives: that poverty is not the cauſe why, but the deſcription of the perſons that are choſen; that Gods decree of election doth commonly runne among the poorer ſort of men, the more to advance his own grace; that man ſhall not ſay, election is intailed upon works: for if poverty ſhould be the cauſe of their election, then all that are poore ſhould be elected, which is falſe. Again further they object,</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God from the beginning hath choſen us to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and beliefe of the truth.</hi> Now ſay they, ſanctification, and faith is made as the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, through which election muſt run, and therefore that is the cauſe or motive why God did elect them. To this we anſwer.</p>
               <p>That it is true, God elects men through ſanctification and faith, as the end God aimes at in elect perſons, not as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for which he elects them. And this anſwer <hi>Rivet</hi> gives. All elect men ſhall be ſanctified, and all elect men ſhall believe; though it is not for this ſanctification and beliefe that they are elected. It is not for grace, but unto grace they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. This diſtinction the Scripture gives, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Ye are elect according to the foreknowl dge of God, through ſanctification unto obedience.</hi> Not for, as the motive; but to, as the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:115140:112"/>Again, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.1. it is called <hi>the faith of Gods elect.</hi> Now, ſay they, it is called ſo, becauſe God elects them foreſeeing their faith. To which we anſwer.</p>
               <p>That faith is here called, the faith of Gods elect; not as if God foreſeeing faith did elect men; but becauſe all elect men ſhall believe, becauſe faith is a peculiar priviledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing onely to elect men, therefore it is called their faith.</p>
               <p>And then laſtly, one Scripture more they alledge, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. <hi>If any man ſhall purge himſelf from ſin, he ſhall be a veſſell of honour.</hi> Now here, ſay they, <hi>purging,</hi> that is, ſanctification, and good works, it is made a condition of election, of being a veſſell of honour. God makes this condition, if he forſee a man will purge himſelfe, and will live holily, that man ſhall be elected, ſhall be a veſſell of honour. To which we give this anſwer, That purging and ſanctification is here laid down, not as the cauſe, but as the ſigne of their election; not as the cauſe why men are veſſels of honour, but the ſigne or evidence that they are ſo. If you are purged, you ſhall be veſſels of honour; that is, if you are ſanctified, it is a ſign to you, that you are elected.</p>

I am now to proceed further in the diſpatch of what yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines to be ſpoken concerning this ſubject. A fourth query followes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Q. </seg>
                  </label> Fourthly, Whether the decree of election, or Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſave a company of men, being from eternity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immutable, whether doth not this give way to man to be ſecure, and careleſſe in the uſe of the means of grace, that they take no care to get grace, and to get heaven, while they are in the world? This is a very uſefull point to inſiſt upon, ſeeing the <hi>Arminians</hi> charge us with this, that if we hold election without reſpect to Gods foreſight of workes in men, then this layes open a gap for men to live as they liſt, that they ſhall ſay, If God hath determined they ſhall be ſaved, they ſhall be ſaved; if that they ſhall be damned, they ſhall be damned, whether they are holy, or profane; if God hath elected them to life, they ſhall be ſaved, let them live as they liſt. Thus the <hi>Arminians</hi> plead. This therefore is the query, whether this doctrine of election doth adminiſter any ground for ſuch a cavill as this to be in the minds of men?</p>
               <p>To anſwer which, I ſhall firſt lay down this generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, That the decree, or the purpoſe of God about the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115140:113"/>election of man to life and ſalvation, doth no way adminiſter any juſt ground to men, to make them live as they liſt, and to make them neglect the means of grace and ſalvation. In the clearing of which, I ſhall lay down three particulars, to ſatisfie you about this matter. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that Gods decree about Civill and Temporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, doth no way give encouragement to men to neglect the uſe of means, and live careleſſe of the accompliſhment of his decree; and therefore not ſo in ſpirituall. As now for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: God hath determined from all eternity, how long every one of us ſhall live in the world; our daies are numbred in his counſell. Now, though God hath determined how long we ſhall live, this no way gives us encouragement to ſay therefore I will never put on a rag of cloathes to cover me in Winter, and I will never put a morſell of meat in my mouth; for God hath determined how long I ſhall live, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether I eate or no, till then I ſhall not die. Again, God hath determined from all eternity, touching every one of us, whether we ſhall be poore or rich in this world, and therefore to draw this concluſion, that it is no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I be induſtrious in following my calling, and looking after my trade, or whether I ſpend my eſtate in rioting and drunkenneſſe; God hath determined whether I ſhall be rich or poore; if he hath decreed I ſhall be poore, I ſhall be poore; or that I ſhall be rich, I ſhall be rich, let me live as I pleaſe: this reaſoning is very fond and fooliſh in Temporall things, therefore much more in Spirituall. God hath determined from all eternity whether thou ſhalt be ſaved or damned, and the decree of God cannot be changed; but now to draw hence, that it is no matter how I live, whether in waies of holineſſe, or in waies of ſinne, this is an abuſive collection from Gods decree. Becauſe, as Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaith, if a man doth not uſe thoſe means that may evidence to his ſoule that he is elected, it is an argument he is not elected. If thou ſay, if God hath determined it, he will ſave me, whether I am holy or prophane, and therefore I will never heare Sermon, never pray in my family, never uſe holy duties; Saith <hi>Preſton,</hi> if
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115140:113"/>thou neglect theſe means, it is an argument thou art not ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; becauſe, as God hath elected thee to the end, he hath alſo ordained thee to uſe the means. I have read a ſtory of an <hi>Italian,</hi> who lying upon his death-bed, ſent for a Phyſician, the moſt exquiſite and exact Artiſt in all <hi>Italy;</hi> and this man held this opinion I am now ſpeaking of, that ſeeing Gods decrees were unalterable, a man might live as he liſt, and yet be ſaved; that let a man be as holy as he could be, if God had decreed his damnation, he ſhould be damned; and let a man be never ſo wicked, if God have decreed his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee ſhould be ſaved; and that the decree of God tooke off the uſe of all means, that a man need not uſe any meanes, but onely truſt in God. The Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian being a man acquainted in the myſteries of Religion, after he had asked him the ſtate of his body, and where the diſeaſe lay, the party deſiring him to preſcribe ſome phiſick, the Phiſician gave him this anſwer: ſaith he, God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined how long you ſhall live; therefore, if I give you phyſick, if God hath determined you ſhall die, you ſhall die for all that; and if he hath decreed you ſhall live, though I give you no phyſick, yet you ſhall live. And this anſwer (ſaith the Hiſtorian) took ſuch place with the <hi>Italian,</hi> that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him in this very principle, and he became a man very diligent in following the means of grace, upon this very ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And indeed, a juſt &amp; grounded ſpeech it is. This therefore is my firſt anſwer, that if ſuch reaſonings as theſe in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things are unreaſonable, they are much more in ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to you that make this plea, I would ſay this: That at that very ſame inſtant wherein God did decree or determine to bring any man to life, at that very inſtant God did decree likewiſe that that man ſhould be holy before hee died; he ſhall uſe all ſanctified and holy means conducible to his ſalvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he did predeſtinate to be conformable to the Image of his ſonne.</hi> God the Father, in that very decree wherein he did ordain man to life, did ordaine, that thoſe men elected ſhould live conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He hath choſen us in Chriſt,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115140:114"/>before the foundation of the world was laid, that we ſhould be holy and blameleſſe before him in love.</hi> God did decree, that our lives ſhould be holy; he ordaines holineſſe as the means, as well as heaven as the end. So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>God hath created us in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which he hath before ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that we ſhould walke in them.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. God, before the world was, at that very inſtant wherein he ordained, and choſe men to life, did alſo ordaine, that men ſhould live a holy and blameleſſe life here upon earth. Now then, for men to make this objection, that ſeeing God hath decreed men to life, therefore men may live as they liſt, is abſurd: for if men doe live as they liſt, it is an argument God did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree them to life, becauſe God in decreeing men to life and ſalvation, did decree they ſhould walk in a courſe of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and holy living in this world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe this ſhould be taken for granted, that God had decreed to damne thee or me; that God in his purpoſe had appointed he would not ſave us; yet God, as a Creator, deſerves thy ſervice. God, as Creator, may lay claime to thy duties. Though God ſhould condemne us, yet he making us, deſerves obedience, and deſerves duties of thankfulneſſe from us. And therefore, under this notion onely, though no other conſideration be looked after, this ſhould engage you to righteous living; and this ſhould engage you in a way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though he never ſave you. <hi>Adam,</hi> though he never ſhould come to heaven, being in innocency, yet being made and created by God, was engaged to live a holy life. And ſo it is with every man alive, as we are creatures, and have a being from God, and the comforts of this life from God, all this doth oblige us to a courſe of obedience, and righteous living toward God, though he ſhould throw us into hell, when we have done. And thus much for reſolving the fourth Query, that the decree of God touching mans election to life, doth no way give encouragement to men to live as they liſt, upon the forementioned grounds. I now paſſe to the fifth Query.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, what temptations doth the divell ſuggeſt into the minds of godly men, to make them doubt within themſelves,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115140:114"/>that they are not elected by God, when indeed they are, to make them thinke they are <hi>reprobate ſilver,</hi> when they are <hi>veſſels of honour, meet for their Maſters uſe?</hi> Happily I may ſpeak to ſome, whoſe ſpirits are perplexed in this caſe. And the anſwer hereunto, I ſhall reduce to three heads, and as I lay them down, labour to take them off, that they may be no juſt ground or reaſon to make you doubt of your election.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the divell tempts a godly man with this, that ſure you cannot be elected, Becauſe that before your calling you were ſo exceeding ſinfull and profane in your lives; ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly profane, vile, wicked livers, that certainly (the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel will ſay) ſuch as you could not fall within the compaſſe of Gods purpoſe to ſave.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the divell will tell you, that certainly you cannot be elected to life, becauſe that after your calling into Jeſus Chriſt, you have fallen ſo fouly into capitall, and ſcandalous crimes and ſinnes.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, becauſe that God doth continually purſue his people with outward and great afflictions; thence the divell will gather, you are not the choſen and beloved of God. Theſe three grand temptations he doth many times faſten upon many tender conſciences, meerly to create a world of doubts and perplexities in the choſen veſſels of mercy. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the firſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the divell tempts you, that ſure you are not elected, becauſe your lives were ſo exceedingly profane, and you were ſuch abominable ill livers, before you tooke upon you the profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt; this the divell layes before many a poore ſoule to ſtumble at.</p>
               <p>To ſatisfie you in this therefore, I ſhall lay down four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars by way of anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Many of the ſervants of God before their calling, have been very lewd, wicked, notorious, profane livers, and yet have been within the compaſſe of Gods election to life and glory. Caſt your eyes upon <hi>Paul,</hi> and there you ſhall finde what he was before his call. He tels you himſelfe, <hi>I was a bluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,</hi> (a horrible ſinne) <hi>I was a perſecuter, I was injurious
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115140:115"/>to God Church. I haled men to priſon for profeſſing the name of Jeſus.</hi> (Theſe are great ſinnes.) Nay further, ſaith he, <hi>I was exceeding mad againſt the Church of God.</hi> A man enraged with malice againſt the people of God. Now what could be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile then theſe? And yet you ſhall finde this man, a choſen veſſell of mercy. Nay, you ſhall finde, God to ſtrengthen the confidence of men upon their election, puts a ſcandalous liver and election together, to make men ſee, that a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous life before converſion, is no prejudice to a mans election. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>And Ananias ſaid, Lord, we have heard of this man by many</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>how much evill he hath done to thy Saints at Hieruſalem.</hi> We have heard by many what an evill man this is, <hi>and that he hath authority from the chiefe P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ieſts to binde all that call upon thy Name;</hi> and that this man did doe it, did execute his commiſſion; here was a wicked liver: but now mark what the Lord ſaith, <hi>Goe thy way, for he is a choſen veſſell to me.</hi> Here you ſee <hi>Ananias</hi> laies his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and his wickedneſſe before him; and yet, <hi>Goe thy way,</hi> ſaith God: <hi>Goe thy way, for he is a choſen veſſell to me.</hi> The like inſtances we have in <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> This therefore is my firſt anſwer, that many of the ſervants of God have been men of very ill and notorious lives, before conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and yet they have been within the compaſſe of Gods election to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though men have been notoriouſly wicked, in their lives before calling, yet if this notorious wickedneſſe doth lay an engagement upon them, to make them labour to be more eminent in grace after calling; this is rather a ſigne of election, then reprobation. It is obſervable in <hi>Paul,</hi> he was a notorious wicked man before his call; but now this exceeding wickedneſſe of his before his call, did engage him to labour to exceed all others in goodneſſe after he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and the more evill he was before, the more holy he labours to be after. As he laboured before to hale men to priſon for profeſſing Jeſus Chriſt, he is now as zealous to draw men to Jeſus Chriſt after his call; he was very induſtrious to doe evill before his call, and this made him after his call, as he
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115140:115"/>ſaith himſelfe, <hi>I was in labours more abundant then they all.</hi> And ſo <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who before her calling was a vile woman, one that was a common harlot; a woman out of whom Jeſus Chriſt caſt ſeven divels; and yet this woman, after her calling, ſhe laboured to be more eminent in godly ſorrow, then any woman before or ſince; <hi>ſhe waſhed Chriſts feet with her teares, and wiped them with the haires of her head.</hi> The like of which you do not read of any woman in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And this was a very good ſigne; when your notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in waies of ſinne before calling, ſhall lay ſuch an engagement upon you to become more eminent in grace after calling; this is a very good encouragement or evidence that you are within the compaſſe of Gods election; and therefore you have no cauſe to be diſcouraged. Suppoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word laid hold upon your conſcience, you were guilty of filthy ſinnes, not fit to be named in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if you will the more honour God, and praiſe God now, and walk more humbly, and labour to excell each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in grace now, as you did in ſinne in times paſt. This is a great ſigne that you are in the company of Gods Elect ones.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you that have been ſcandalous in your lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling, for your comfort know, that God in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counſell doth commonly make the profane and wicked and the worſt of men, the objects of his election, rather then civill honeſt men, rather then men that are of an honeſt and civill, and morall converſation here in this world. And the Lord doth it upon this ground, the more to magnifie the freeneſſe, and the riches of his own grace in electing men to life. For ſhould God onely chuſe moderate and civill honeſt men in the world, men would be apt to think it is that mans morality, and that mans civility, that was the motive which provoked God to elect them; and therefore God, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw theſe thoughts, he lets election runne rather unto men that have been notoriouſly groſſe and ſinfull in their lives, then other men; <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> a notorious bloudy man, yet falls within the compaſſe of Gods election, when many a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115140:116"/>civill man is left out. <hi>Mary,</hi> a common harlot, yet choſen, when many a modeſt chaſte woman was caſt into hell. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31, 32. There Chriſt urgeth a parable of two men. <hi>One that ſaid he would go and follow Chriſt, but did not; and the other ſaid he would not goe, but did; now which of theſe twaine did the will of Chriſt? and they ſaid, the firſt. And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, that publicans and harlots ſhall goe into heaven before you.</hi> But you will ſay, was this common? this was onely one ſingle time: therefore mark the next words, <hi>For John came to you in the way of righteouſneſſe, and you believed not; but the publicans and harlots believed in Chriſt. John</hi> came preaching, and you would not believe, you <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> ſtrict morall men, that did not flie out into ſuch ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals as other men did, you would not believe, ſaith Chriſt, but <hi>Publicans,</hi> men that were moſt addicted to extortion, and unconſcionable gaine, <hi>they imbraced Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men would not. This therefore ſhould be another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for you, that many times election runnes rather to the profaner ſort of men, then to men that are civill and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dealing men here in the world; and this God doth to magnifie the riches of his own grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that it is no matter what you were before your calling, ſo you are a repentant and holy people after; your former miſcarriages ſhall no way prejudice your future bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Neither Fornicator, nor Idolater, nor Adulterer, nor envious, nor thiefe, nor covetous, nor reviler ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven: and ſuch were ſome of you &amp;c.</hi> Here you ſee a Catalogue of vile evils heaped together, <hi>and ſuch were ſome of you; but now you are waſhed, now you are ſanctified, &amp;c.</hi> So that no matter what you were before converſion, though guilty of great ſinnes, ſo you are now a reformed people, now a ſanctified people, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.3. <hi>We our ſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, and living in malice and envie, &amp;c.</hi> You were ſo; <hi>but after the kindneſſe and love of God appeared to you,</hi> after they were called and converted they were not ſo. So that theſe foure particulars will clearly take off this
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115140:116"/>objection, that no matter what you were before converſion, if you are now a repentant people, and bewaile your evils, and reform your waies, your former ill led life will be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance at all to your election. Indeed this I muſt needs ſay, that you that have been moſt notorious in ſinne, God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects this at your hands, that you be moſt eminent in grace, moſt deep in humiliation, moſt eminent in godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, though your former evills doe no way prejudice your election.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the divell cannot faſten this upon you, he will come upon you with this aſſault, <hi>viz.</hi> your frequent falling into ſcandalous and foule, and groſſe enormities, after you took upon you a profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. And this the divell will lay cloſe: happily ſinne before converſion was not ſo great; but now ſince you have followed Sermons, and ſince you have profeſſed Jeſus Chriſt, ſince that time you have fallen foulely into groſſe and ſcandalous ſinnes, and ſurely this is inconſiſtent with grace, and cannot befall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons within the compaſſe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>And I confeſſe this is both ſad and hazardous: yet I ſhall lay down three things to uphold thee, that yet for all this thou maiſt be within the compaſſe of Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that divers perſons who were within the compaſſe of Gods election, have fallen foulely into groſſe ſinnes after their call. <hi>Lot,</hi> after he was called, fell to be inceſtuous, and fell to drunkenneſſe; <hi>David,</hi> after he was called, fell into Adultery; <hi>Peter,</hi> after he was called, fell to a deniall of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Yea, you read of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.9. <hi>That his heart was turned from the Lord, after the Lord had revealed himſelfe unto him twice.</hi> After God had revealed himſelfe to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and converted him; after that time he did evill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his God. Nay, you read further, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.26, 27. That <hi>Solomons wives turned away his heart from the Lord, though he was the beloved of his God.</hi> Though he were belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by God, and were elected by him, yet his wives turned away his heart from the Lord. The like phraſe you have
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115140:117"/>
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.22. <hi>After all theſe great works, I have done amongst them, and the miracles I have ſhewn them in Aegypt, and in the Wilderneſſe, they have provoked me, ſaith the Lord, theſe ten times.</hi> After they were the Lords by covenant, and after they were a delivered people; after this they provoked him many a time, by ſinning againſt him, and yet divers of them were elect veſſels of mercy. So that, I ſay, many of Gods ſervants after their calling, are fallen foulely into ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſinnes, and yet have been within the compaſſe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you falling into groſſe and ſcandalous ſinnes, have not theſe foure ſinfull ingredients, your falling into ſinne after calling, may be conſiſtent with election. Firſt, if you fall not into ſinne voluntarily. Secondly, if you fall not into the ſame ſinne frequently. Thirdly, if you fall not into ſinne with complacency. And fourthly, if you lie not under your fall impenitently. If theſe ingredients be mixed with your ſinning after your call, they are inconſiſtent with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Firſt, if you fall into ſinne voluntarily, <hi>that you ruſh into ſinne, as a horſe into the battell.</hi> Secondly, if you fall into the ſame ſinne frequently, then it is hazardous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. It is true <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt, but it was but in one fit of a temptation. <hi>David</hi> fell into Adultery, but it was never but once; <hi>Lot</hi> was guilty of drunkenneſſe, but onely in one fit: For the ſervants of God, though they fall, yet they fall not frequently into the ſame ſinne, if groſſe and ſcandalous. Thirdly, if you fall into ſinne with compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that you take pleaſure in the evils you fall into; if you doe as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>wallow ſinne under your tongue;</hi> counting it ſweet and delightſome to you. And laſtly, if all this be joyned with impenitency, that you have not a heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the evils you fal into, the Lord have mercy upon you; for certainly, if you fall into ſinne with theſe ingredients, you are not within the compaſſe of Gods mercy to ſave. But now, though you doe fall into ſinne, if it be not voluntary, but through the force of temptation: if it be not with compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, but a diſlike of the ſins you fall into; and as ſoon as
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115140:117"/>you doe fall, and ſee your ſinnes you repent and riſe again, though you doe fall in this way, it will be no prejudice to your election.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, falling into ſinne after calling and profeſſion made of Jeſus Chriſt, may be conſiſtent with election in theſe foure caſes. Firſt, if the ſinnes you fall into be clearly diſcerned. Secondly, if they are ſenſibly bewailed. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they are ſtrongly reſiſted; and laſtly, if they are daily laboured, and prayed againſt. Though you doe fall into ſinne, yet in theſe caſes ſinne will not be damning to you, or be an impediment to your election. And thus I have done with the ſecond caſe of conſcience. Onely, let me urge this one thing before I leave it, (for I would not have you make this doctrine a doctrine of liberty; but I would have you lay this to heart) that if any of you doe fall foulely, after conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; believe it, God will make you ſmart for this, though not in hell, yet you ſhall have a hell in your conſcience, you ſhall have the very preguſtations of hell, a wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and God will expect deep humiliation, and great repentance, if you ſinne after profeſſion made of Jeſus Chriſt. It may have that influence upon you, as upon <hi>David,</hi> who cried out, <hi>I have no quietneſſe in my bones, by reaſon of my ſinne.</hi> God will give you no reſt night nor day by reaſon of ſinne, if you runne into it after profeſſion made of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, men doe doubt of their election, becauſe God purſues them with continuall afflictions, and layes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtrokes of his heavy wrath upon them; and this makes many a godly man thinke, that he is not in the number of Gods elect ones. To which I ſhall briefly anſwer.</p>
               <p>That this is nothing elſe but a temptation, and not a truth; and it was the very controverſie that <hi>Jobs</hi> friends had with him; they would faſten this upon <hi>Job,</hi> that he was a Reprobate, and an Hypocrite, becauſe God did ſo afflict him: yet <hi>Job</hi> maintained his ſincerity, and ſhewes his grounds, that God was his friend, and that he did not reject him, though he did afflict him. But to ſpeake more particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:115140:118"/>Firſt, no man can infallibly and certainly judge of Gods purpoſes about mans election, or reprobation, by any of the diſpenſations of God toward their bodies in the things of this life. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1, 2. <hi>No man knows either love or hatred by any thing that is before him. All things fall alike to all. The ſame event to him that feareth God, and to him that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him not, to him that ſweareth, and to him that feareth an Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Afflictions from God are ſo farre from being grounds, or evidences that a man is not elected, that in ſome caſes they may prove evidences that they are the very elect of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7. <hi>He chaſteneth every ſonne whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; they are baſtards, and not ſonnes, whom he chaſtiſeth not. As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten, be zealous therefore and repent.</hi> Revel. 3.19. In ſome caſes afflictions from God are rather tokens of love from God, then the contrary. As now, in caſe afflictions be as a ſpur to you, to make you quicken your pace in heaven way. 2. In caſe your afflictions be as pruning-hookes to you, to cut and lop off the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant buddings, and workings of ſinne in the heart. 3. In caſe affliction be as a hedge to you to keep you in, and to make you walke in a cloſe communion with God, and not to wander or goe aſtray from him. 4. In caſe affliction be as a file to you, to file off that ruſt that cleaves to your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 5. In caſe affliction proves a furnace to refine you from that droſſe of corruption that is mixt with your ſervices. In theſe caſes afflictions are ſo farre from being grounds to doubt of your election, that they may rather give you evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, you are the very elect of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that God in his wiſdome doth many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his own people to greater troubles in this life, then he lets wicked and reprobate men undergoe. God will not give reprobates their hell here, that ſo he might give them hell hereafter. God will not give the elect heaven here, to make heaven more deſirable to them, while they live here; and more welcome when they come there. It is Gods pleaſure
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115140:118"/>in the diſpenſations of his providence amongſt men, to let his own people lie under more outward ſorrows, then wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men ſhall doe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.5. <hi>Their eyes burſt out with fatneſſe, they are not in trouble, as other men, neither are they plagued, as other men are.</hi> The Lord in his diſpenſations doth ſo deale with wicked men, that they are not plagued, they are not troubled, as godly men are in this world. And therefore ſurely affliction is no argument of Gods diſpleaſure, or of their not being within the compaſſe of Gods purpoſe to doe them good.</p>

                  <q>Wherefore the rather, Brethren, give all diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THe Doctrine I am yet upon is this, <hi>That Chriſtians ſhould put forth a great deale of diligence to make this ſure to their ſoules, that they are eternally elected by God to life and ſalvation.</hi> In the proſecution of which Doctrine, I have gone over ſeverall particulars; and have now only one Querie more to ſatisfie about election; and then to winde up this Doctrine, in laying down ſome explicatory propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, very conducible to illuſtrate this Doctrine of Election. And the Quere to be reſolved is this.</p>
               <p>What are thoſe deluſions of the divell whereby he nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth preſumptuous perſwaſions in the minds of men, that they are elected by God, when they are not? And to anſwer this, I ſhall reduce all I have to ſay under theſe three heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the divell perſwades wicked men that they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, upon this ground. Becauſe they doe not break forth into ſuch groſſe and ſcandalous enormities in their lives, as many men that live about them doe: and therefore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell boulſters them up in this, Surely if you were not elected, you would be as bad as any, and as vile and exorbitant as any. Now ſeeing God keepes you in, that you act not ſuch things in your lives, as other men doe; this may be a comfortable evidence to you, that you are in the number of Gods elect ones. And this deluſion deceives thouſands of people, eſpecially morallized, and civillized men; they runne hoodwinkt to hell, nouriſhing hopes of life and ſalvation, and never feele the contrary, till they come
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115140:119"/>to death and hell. I ſhall declare this to be a deluſion, in laying down four or five particulars. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there are many men, that are mentioned in Scripture, not to have been within the compaſſe of Gods election, who yet were men of very blameleſſe and honeſt lives, not blemiſhed with any groſſe and ſcandalous evils. Read <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11, 14. of the Phariſee. He tels you, <hi>he thanks God he was no extortioner, no adulterer, no covetous perſon, no drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, nor was he as wicked as the Publican was.</hi> Here you ſee a man that ſpake vauntingly and truely, that he was not a man that broke out into thoſe miſcarriages other men did; yet what was this man? An elect veſſell? No. Read verſ. 14. and the Text tels you, <hi>the Publican went away juſtified, rather then the other;</hi> the Phariſee, though he was free from ſcandalous and groſſe enormities in his life, yet he was not a juſtified man, and ſo by conſequence not an elect man. You read of Hypocrites, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>that cleanſed the outſide of the cup and of the platter,</hi> that is, cleanſed their converſations, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the outward man of groſſe ſcandals, <hi>and yet within were full of filth;</hi> and Chriſt tels us, they were <hi>hypocrites,</hi> that <hi>ſhould have their portion in hell.</hi> And ſhould you view over Hiſtorians that write of the Scribes and Phariſees, and ſtrict men among the Jewes, they will tell you what wonderfull holy-lived men they were; they were often in duties, faſted twice a week, prayed every day in the corners of the ſtreets; none ſo ſtrict as they in obſerving the Sabbath; would goe vailed, leſt they ſhould be enſnared by laſcivious objects; and yet theſe very men ſo wonderfull ſtrict, and cautious, were men that had no dram of grace in them at all. Though they were a people thus well dreſſed in their lives, yet the Scripture tels us of them, that Whores and Harlots ſhould goe to Heaven before them. This therefore is the firſt, that many men have had their lives free from groſſe ſcandals, and yet were men that were not elected by God to life and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that a mans converſation may be free from ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinnes, yet if this freedome from ſcandals proceed from a wrong principle, it may be in a perſon not elected. As I will
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115140:120"/>make it appeare. There may be a freedome from groſſe ſinnes proceeding from a threefold principle, and yet a man be in a ſtate of damnation and of reprobation. As firſt, There may be a freedome from ſcandals, proceeding from religious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ſecondly, from a naturall diſpoſition; and thirdly, from the power of reſtraining grace. Firſt, there may be a freedome from groſſe ſinnes, proceeding from the power of education. So the young man in the Goſpell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.18, 19, 20. when Chriſt told him what the Law was. <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, thou ſhalt not ſteale, thou ſhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt doe no murder, thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Saith the young man, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth.</hi> He was a Phariſee, and his parents ſtrict in their courſe of living, and brought him up ſo from his youth; and yet this man no elect man, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. Secondly, a man may be free from ſcandalous ſins, ariſing from an ingenious naturall diſpoſition. A mans diſpoſition may ſometimes be utterly averſe to ſome ſinnes. <hi>Plutarch</hi> a heathen could ſay this, I had rather it were ſaid, there were no ſuch man as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the world, then to ſay, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> was unchaſte, <hi>Plutarch</hi> was a drunkard, or <hi>Plutarch</hi> was a ſwearer. Mans naturall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per may ſometimes be free from groſſe ſinnes, and yet he not an elect perſon for all this. And then thirdly, a man may be free from groſſe ſinnes, as proceeding from the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. <hi>I alſo withheld Abimelech from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt me.</hi> He was a heathen, and a wicked man, and yet God, by the power of reſtraining grace, did keepe <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> from running into that exorbitant courſe of ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. So that if a man be free from groſſe ſinnes, and yet proceeding from falſe principles, a man may not be an elect man for all this. Unleſſe your freedome from ſinne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a renewed nature, from a ſanctified heart, and from the ſaving operation of the holy ghoſt; unleſſe it comes from theſe principles, your freedome from groſſe ſinnes can be no pledge to your ſoules, that you are elected by God to life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that a man having a good life, free from ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115140:120"/>ſinnes, if he have not a good heart, that is no argument of a man that is within the compaſſe of Gods election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; nor is that circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh, but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly, and circumciſion is of the heart, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God.</hi> Intimating, that he is not a Chriſtian; he is not an elect Jew, that was one outwardly; that is, that was conformable to the rites and cuſtomes of the Jewes; but he was one that was one inwardly, that had his ſinnes morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, his nature changed, and his heart cleanſed, he was an elect Jew. So that to have a holy life, if a man have not an holy heart, is no ſign that a man is within the compaſſe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God in electing men to life, doth paſſe by morall and civill honeſt men, that truſt and depend upon their own righteouſneſſe and ſtrict living, rather then any ſort of men in the World. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31, 33. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John Baptiſt preached the Goſpel of repentance, but you believed not, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and harlots believed.</hi> Thoſe Phariſees that did depend upon their own righteouſneſſe, &amp; their own goodneſſe, Chriſt did not call them, Chriſt did not own them, God made them not the objects of his election. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Chriſt came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance:</hi> that is, men depending upon their own righteouſneſſe, and their own parts, they are left out by Chriſt, as if he came not for them; but Chriſt came to call ſinners, that ſee their ſinne, and were vile in their own eyes, Chriſt came to call ſuch. Againe,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond deluſion, whereby the divel makes men think they are elected by God, is drawn from their externall voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that they are not onely civilized, and moralized ones, but they finde the power of the word to call them; and upon this vocation they bottom the hopes of their election. And they have Scripture for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom God predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates he calls.</hi> Now God hath called them by the word, and they have found the word come with power upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to reforme the evils of their life. (And the power of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115140:121"/>vocation they deem higher (as indeed it is) then the power of education, or naturall temper;) and therefore, think they, I having vocation, this is an evidence to me of my election. To this deluſion I ſhall only ſay two things, by way of anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is true indeed, the Scripture ſaith, all whom God predeſtinates, he calls; but the Scripture doth not ſay, that all whom he calls, he predeſtinates. No man that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points to life, but before he dies, God will call him by the word; but God doth not ſay any where, that thoſe whom he cals, them he did predeſtinate to life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, many men are outwardly called by the word into a profeſſion of Chriſt, when they are not eternally elected by God to ſalvation. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> Many are called, but all thoſe that are externally called by the word, are not choſen, nor all ordained to life. A man may be called from ignorance to knowledge, yet not elected. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>After they were enlightned, and had taſted the word of God, and the power of the world to come, yet they fell away.</hi> A man may be called from profaneneſſe to profeſſion, from the world into the Church, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was, yet not elected, but remaine <hi>in the gall of bitterneſſe, and bond of iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, A third deluſion, whereby men are deceived by the divell, to think they are elected, when they are not is this, If they cannot plead their education, and morall manner of living, or if they cannot plead their vocation, their laſt plea is, the mercy of God; they hope God is a mercifull God, and God made them not all to damne them; they are Gods creatures, made by him, and God that made them, will ſave them; and hereupon they faſten their hopes, that they are in the number of Gods elect ones. This is a ſtrong deluſion, eſpecially amongſt ignorant people. And to this I ſhall anſwer in two particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when as men ſay, God is a mercifull God, therefore they hope they are elected, I anſwer: It is true, God is a mercifull God, yet God is as juſt as mercifull; he is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully juſt, and juſtly mercifull; his mercy cannot intrench
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115140:121"/>upon his juſtice, nor ſhall his juſtice intrench upon his mercy; one Attribute ſhall not claſh with another; he is no more mercifull, then he is juſt, nor is he more juſt then he is mercifull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though God be a mercifull God, yet Gods ſaving mercy is not ſo large as to extend to all creatures that live, that he hath made. You read <hi>Eſay</hi> 27.11. <hi>This is a people of no underſtanding, therefore hee that made them will not have mercy upon them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> Here you ſee, the Prophet tels them, that that God that made them will damne them, and that God that formed them, that God will ſhew them no favour. So that Gods mercy extends not ſo farre, as to reach to all the works of his hands; for if ſo, the divels might claime ſalvation as well as man; for God made them when they were glorious Angels, as well as man: and therefore, if all the works of Gods hands ſhould plead for ſalvation, they might as well come within the compaſſe of Gods election, as wicked men doe.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee in theſe ſeverall Sermons, I have finiſhed the Doctrines of Effectuall Vocation, and Eternall election. I will now a little illuſtrate the point, by laying down ten Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which will ſerve to cleare the Doctrine of Election in many points about it, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That all men are not the objects of Gods election, or of Gods choice. And this propoſition doth confute the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Origen. Origen</hi> was of this mind, that all mankind ſhould be ſaved, nay, the very divels themſelves, they ſhould all be ſaved by Chriſt. A moſt groundleſſe, and unheard of opinion; for all men are not elected to ſalvation. <hi>Jude</hi> tels us, in his Epiſtle, there were ſome <hi>of old ordained to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> and if ſo, ſurely they could not fall within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of Gods election, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. There are ſome <hi>ordained to wrath;</hi> but we are not amongſt them ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but we are ordained to obtaine ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All are not objects of Gods election to life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the feweſt ſort of men and women that God
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115140:122"/>hath made are the the objects of his election. God in his own counſell hath elected to life and ſalvation the feweſt ſort of men and women in the world. And this is a very dreadfull point, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen. Matth.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>A remnant, according to the election of grace.</hi> And here in purſuing this head, I ſhall lay down two things under this propoſition: Firſt, that there are but few rich men choſen by God to life and ſalvation. Secondly, there are but few civill honeſt men choſen by God to life and ſalvation. There are but few rich men that fall within the compaſſe of Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſave, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Not many mighty,</hi> (he doth not ſay, not any; but <hi>not many mighty</hi>) <hi>not many Noble, not many great ones of the world are choſen.</hi> You read <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.24. <hi>That it is as eaſie for a Camell to goe thorough a Needles eye, as for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of God. As eaſie for a Camell.</hi> It is not meant in this ſence, as ſome expound it. That there was a gate in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> called the Needles eye; a little and low gate, which their Camels being laden could not goe through, and therefore they muſt unload the burden, and the Camell ſtoop before they could enter. Some think Chriſts ſpeech had relation to that <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, that inſtead of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Camel, they read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Cable; which, if untwiſted may be put through the eye of a Needle, but the knot is not untied, but cut by this expoſition. But the words were a proverbiall ſpeech among the Jewes, who had this proverb amongſt them, that when any one ſpake things either unlikely or unproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they would ſay, This can be as eaſily done, as a Camel can goe through a Needles eye. And Chriſt, alluding to this Proverb, ſaith, that rich men, that dote upon their riches, and cleave to their wealth, and rather part with heaven, and Chriſt, and ſoule and all, then part with their riches, Chriſt makes it an unpoſſible thing for ſuch rich men to come into heaven. As I once told what <hi>Buchanan</hi> ſaid, lying upon his death-bed in a meſſage to King <hi>James,</hi> I am going to that place, where few Kings come. And, beloved, the ſpeech is true, for <hi>not many wiſe, not many mighty, not many Noble hath the Lord choſen.</hi> Secondly, few civill honeſt men doe fall
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115140:122"/>within the compaſſe of Gods choyce to ſave. Morall men, that truſt upon their civility and morall honeſty, and plain dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; few or none of theſe come to Heaven. <hi>Publicans and Harlots ſhall come to Heaven before you.</hi> Matth. 21.32. Whores and harlots believe in me, when you doe not, ſaith Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that though God in his own counſell, hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or made choice but of the feweſt number of men and women to life and ſalvation, yet this doth no way intrench upon the mercy of God, this doth no way leſſen or impeach the mercy of God. Men may think, as if ſurely God had caſt off all bowels, and caſt off all mercy. What? God make ſuch a world of men as he hath done, and ſave but a few of theſe? Man might think, as if God were a hard maſter, that deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the deſtruction of man, that had forgotten to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; ſuch a hard charge will they be apt to lay upon God. But now, beloved, that God hath elected ſo few a number to life, this doth no way impeach the mercy of God. And this I make appeare thus: becauſe God was bound to ſave none at all; therefore you cannot challenge God either with unmercifulneſſe, or unfaithfulneſſe, if he ſhould ſave none. It was a meer act of his bounty and good will, that he would ſave any. Nay, ſecondly, there is that in man, in the beſt of men, that might juſtly provoke God not to ſave any: And therefore if God ſave any, it is of grace. And this is a certain rule, that God doth ſhew more mercy in ſaving of one, then he would have done rigour of juſtice, had he damned all. As may be made plain by this compariſon. Suppoſe fourty men guilty of Rebellion were arraigned for their lives, and were condemned to die by the Law; if the Prince pardon foure of theſe forty, he ſhewes more mercy in pardoning the foure, then he doth rigour of juſtice in condemning the forty. Why? becauſe the fact deſerved death, in all alike. So it is with God: every man upon earth deſerves death and damnation; &amp; if God cull out any of the maſſe of mankind, to ſave them, he ſhewes more mercy, then he had done rigorous juſtice, ſhould he have deſtroyed all, becauſe he is bound to ſave none at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:115140:123"/>Fourthly, God in electing a certain number to life, doth it without foreſight of any good works which he ſaw would be in them. Indeed the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> joyn their ſtrength, to maintaine this; God, ſay they, foreſaw men would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and would be holy in their lives, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did chuſe them to life. This you may remember I ſpent ſome time in overthrowing formerly, and therefore paſs it over now. <hi>viz.</hi> That God did not chuſe men to life, with reference to any good works he foreſaw in them. This indeed is an undoubted truth; All men whom God did elect to life, he foreſaw they would have good works in them; but Gods foreſeeing of this, was not the cauſe for which God did elect them. No, the motive was his own will, according to the pleaſure of his own grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>A rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are ſaved according to the election of grace, for if it were of works, grace is no more grace.</hi> Were election upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of good workes, then it would follow, that infants dying in infancy were not within the compaſſe of Gods election, becauſe an infant ſo dying, could not performe any good works; and ſo their caſe would be moſt miſerable. Beſides, we are not juſtified by actuall workes, therefore not elected upon works foreſeen. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. for there is the like reaſon of theſe two.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That Gods election is ſo free, that in chuſing and electing men to life and ſalvation, he doth not doe it for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe. Underſtand this well, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you might both give Chriſt his due, and God the father his due: for miſtake me not. God doth ſave none but by Chriſt, but God did elect men without reference to Jeſus Chriſt as the motive of election, meerly according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his own will. All modern and latter Divines lay down this for a truth, that it was the meere pleaſure, and good will of God to man, that was the motive of Gods elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and not Chriſt. Chriſt could not be the cauſe, becauſe he was the effect. Now what is the effect, cannot be the cauſe. Gods love in electing mankind, did produce Jeſus Chriſt to be the meanes of our ſalvation, and of bringing about Gods
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115140:123"/>election, therefore he being the effect of election cannot be the cauſe. The cauſe of election was eternall, but the merits of Chriſt were not ſo. Again, Chriſt was elected himſelfe. 1 Pet. 1.20. <hi>He was preordained of God before the World was.</hi> Now he that was elected himſelf, could not be the cauſe of our election. Beſides the elect are ſaid to be given to Chriſt to be ſaved, <hi>John</hi> 17.2. therefore he was not the cauſe of our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It is true, the Scripture tels us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>We are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Chriſt,</hi> i. we are elected in Chriſt as a common perſon. God firſt choſe Chriſt, and then believers in Chriſt, as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body. But God elects no man for Chriſts ſake, but man is choſen meerly of Gods bounty, without reference to Jeſus Chriſt. And here Divines ſay, Gods love in electing man to life was as free, as if Chriſt had never died; and it was ſo free, that man was not beholding to Chriſt for his election; and yet Chriſts ſufferings were ſo full, as if men were not bound to God for their election. Thus they are pleaſed to expreſſe it. And the reaſon why the Scripture ſpeakes th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, that we are onely choſen in Chriſt, not for Chriſt, is to give God the Father his due in electing men to life: that God did it meerly of his own grace, and therein Gods love and favour is apparent to all the world, that he did elect man without Chriſt, as the motive of his election: and yet Jeſus Chriſt being come into the world, he carries on our ſalvation, and he is the cauſe of it; though he was not the cauſe of Gods firſt thoughts, in electing man to life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All men that are elected by God to life and ſalvation ſhall ſooner or later before they die be called into a ſtate of converſion, and believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called:</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternall life believed.</hi> So that God the father, in ordaining man to life, hath ordained this alſo, that before they die, they ſhall be a converted and believing people, and therfore men remaining unconverted, uncalled, unbelieving, they are not the objects of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, that God in chuſing or electing men to life, doth let his election runne ordinarily unto the meaneſt, and unto
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115140:124"/>the worſt ſort of men in the world, men that have leaſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall endowments, leſt morall excellencies, leaſt worldly gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry; ordinarily election runs that way. <hi>God hath choſen the poore things of this world, and things deſpiſed, and things that are not hath he choſen.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.27. Jam. 2.5. <hi>Hath not God choſen the poore of this world to be rich in faith.</hi> Ordinarily the Lord chuſeth poor and meane men, that have no naturall or morall excellencies. Hence it was that when Chriſt left the learned Phariſees, and Doctors among the Jewes, the ignorant and poore people, they flocked after Jeſus Chriſt; they looked after Jeſus Chriſt, when the rich and great men of the world had no ſhare in him.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, that a man may be an elect child of God, and yet not expreſſe the fruit of his election in many yeeres here in the world, and this is a very comfortable point. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance you have of this in <hi>Paul.</hi> It is obſervable of <hi>Paul,</hi> the Scripture tels us <hi>he was a choſen veſſell,</hi> Acts 9.15. and yet <hi>Paul</hi> lived many yeeres, before the fruit of his election appeared in him. Some Hiſtorians ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> lived 37. the leaſt ſay 30 yeers, before the fruit of election appeared in him, for he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the very yeere after Chriſts death; and all the while before, he did expreſſe fruit that was ſeemingly repugnant to an elect eſtate, as if a man could not be an elect veſſell, that was ſo vile as he: <hi>he was a blaſpheme, a perſecuter, injurious to the Church, haled men to priſon, mad with rage againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Nay, he was a man that had a hand in putting <hi>Steven</hi> the firſt Martyr to death. So long he lived in a courſe of iniquity, for 30. yeeres together, and yet this man was an elect veſſell then. So the Thiefe upon the Croſſe, an elect child of God, yet did not expreſſe the fruit of his election in repentance and converſion, untill the laſt houre of his life. So that I ſay a man may be an elect childe of God, and yet not expreſſe the fruit of his election in his life for many yeeres.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, that God for the great love he beares to his elect that are in the world, lets Reprobates and wicked men enjoy many mercies and outward deliverances, for their ſakes. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.19, 20. <hi>There ſhall be tribulation,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſuch as was
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115140:124"/>not from the beginning of the world, nor ſhall be to the end thereof: but for the elect ſake thoſe daies ſhall be ſhortned.</hi> For his elect ſake, God did mitigate, did ſhorten, God did take away that trouble from them. So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Had not God leſt us a ſmall remnant, we had been like Sodome, yea like unto Gomorrha.</hi> Had not God left a handfull of his elect and godly men amongſt them, all the reſt had been deſtroyed. So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65.8. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, deſtroy not the people, for a bleſſing is among them.</hi> That is, my people is among them, and my elect is among them, therefore deſtroy them not. God did not deſtroy the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jewes, becauſe God had his own people mixed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. So <hi>Job</hi> 22.30. And this concluſion adminiſters matter of thankfulneſſe, to all men upon earth, to make you bleſſe God, that he keepes his people alive among you, for it is for the elects ſake you have all the outward bleſſings and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies you doe enjoy.</p>
               <p>Tenthly and laſtly, take in this concluſion: That this world ſhall continue no longer, then till the number of Gods elect be accompliſhed; when God hath accompliſhed, and brought in to Chriſt the number of his elect; the world ſhall not ſtand one minute longer after this worke is done. God doth but uphold the world, till the full number of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> be come in. If the number were filled, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt would ſurrender up the Kingdome to his Father.</hi> The Heavens ſhould gather together like a ſcrowle, and the Elements ſhould melt with fervent heat, and this world ſhould come to a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. It is the elect in the world, that keep up the world, that it doth not fall about our eares. And thus having ſpent theſe 16 Sermons touching mans Effectuall calling, and eternall Election, I have now brought all unto a concluſion. And I earneſtly intreat you, let it be your work, <hi>to put forth your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make this ſure to your own ſoules, that you are effectually called, and that you are eternally elected to obtaine life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
