            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> the be≈øt Chri≈øtian; And what could ≈øu≈øtain and beare us up under them all, but the certain hope and expectation of <hi>a better Re≈øurrection?</hi> This makes Chri≈øtians <hi>glory in tribulation,</hi> de≈øpi≈øe all the glory of the world, run as ≈øwiftly in wayes of duty, as the <hi>charets of Amminadab;</hi> in a word, to enjoy a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon earth. They therefore are the greate≈øt enemies of a Chri≈øtians comfort, that teach a doctrine of doubting; that a Chri≈øtian mu≈øt alwayes hang in ≈øu≈øpen≈øe about his eternal ≈øtate; and can never arrive to any certainty, whether he ≈øhall be ≈øaved or no.</p>
            <p>But as this a≈ø≈øurance is excellent, ≈øo is it hard to come by; <hi>Difficilia quae pulchra.</hi> 'Tis not to be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great deal of labour and diligence. 'Tis u≈øually
<pb facs="tcp:115140:3"/>the fruit of much prayer, and care, and humiliation, and long-waiting; tho≈øe that come by it ≈øo ea≈øily, and get it ≈øo ≈øoon, have great cau≈øe to ≈øu≈øpect that their a≈ø≈øurance is not of the right kinde; Carnal ≈øecurity and pre≈øumption is ea≈øily attained, but Chri≈øtian a≈ø≈øurance not without great difficulty.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore much to be lamented, that there is ≈øo little diligence u≈øed, for obtaining the a≈ø≈øurance of our effectual Calling and eternal Election, which is of ≈øuch great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to every Chri≈øtian. What care do men take, &amp; what diligence do they give to make ≈øure their lands, and goods, and worldly e≈øtates? They cannot be at re≈øt till they have ≈øecured the≈øe; But upon what uncertainties do they venture the ≈øalvation of their precious and immortal ≈øouls? They run the mo≈øt de≈øparate hazards of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ≈øalvation; never con≈øider whether they are in the way to heaven or hell, until they drop irrecoverably into the bottomle≈ø≈øe pit. Oh what a ≈øtrange madne≈ø≈øe po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth the mindes of men, that they ≈øhould look no more to their own ≈øafety; that they think it wi≈øedome to ≈øecure every thing except their own ≈øoules. What evil have they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved of you, that you ≈øhould neglect them ≈øo much?</p>
            <p>The de≈øigne of this Treati≈øe is to awaken men from their ≈øecurity, and to ≈øtirre them up to give all diligence to make their Calling and Election ≈øure. It was handled by the Author as a ju≈øt Con≈øectary from the doctrine of the <hi>Glory of Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Torments of Hell,</hi> (which Treati≈øe is already publi≈øhed) as appears in the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this di≈øcour≈øe; That ≈øeeing there is ≈øuch glory prepared for the Elect, and ≈øuch torments for the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it concerns every Chri≈øtian to give all diligence to make ≈øure to him≈øelf, that he ≈øhall attain the one, and e≈øcape
<pb facs="tcp:115140:3"/>the other; So that the≈øe three Treati≈øes have dependance upon each other, and together make up one compleat Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteme. In this la≈øt thou wilt finde many practical ca≈øes handled, of great ≈øoul-concernment, both for the comfort of ≈øuch as are ≈øincere, and the di≈øcovery of tho≈øe that are un≈øound.

Having ≈øpent ≈øeventeen Sermons in treating of the Glory of Heaven for the Elect, and of the Torments of Hell for the Reprobate; I deem'd it mo≈øt meet to ≈øhut up tho≈øe two Doctrines in the pro≈øecution of this Subject, of the <hi>A≈ø≈øurance of our Election and Vocation,</hi> that ≈øo if this Doctrine be well improved, you may have e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhment in your own hearts, that you are freed from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115140:5"/>torments of the Damned, and may be confident you ≈øhall be ≈øtated into the Glory of Heaven, which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for all his Saints. And to the end you might have a≈ø≈øurance, that you ≈øhall be freed from the one, and ≈øhall enjoy the other, you mu≈øt make it your work, according to the words of my Text, <hi>to make your Calling and Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øure:</hi> Make but that ≈øure, and you are ≈øure of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This is the rea≈øon why I pitch'd upon this Subject: And it is my care in preaching the Word, not to chu≈øe tho≈øe Texts that are mo≈øt for my ea≈øe in ≈øtudy, but for your profit in hearing; that ≈øo one Subject might back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and one Subject might ≈øtrengthen another, and being put together, might more ≈øerve for your edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and knowledg.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall not ≈øtand long in Prefacing: All that I have to do in the managing of the≈øe words, are the≈øe three things.</p>

The Spirit of God wrought the ≈øame Faith among tho≈øe ≈øcattered Chri≈øtians. And the Apo≈øtle writing to the≈øe Jewes, he begins his Epi≈øtle, fir≈øt by way of Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Grace and peace be multiplied to you.</hi> 2.

And this he pre≈ø≈øeth by a double Argument: Fir≈øt, con≈øidering the benefit ≈øhall redound to them, in ca≈øe they perform this duty to labour to thrive in grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>If the≈øe things be in you and abound, they ≈øhall make you that you ≈øhall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledg of the Lord Je≈øus.</hi> If you make it your work to grow in grace, you ≈øhall never be a barren or unfruitful people; but you ≈øhall be growing in grace, and thriving in God ≈øtill. 2.

And then he comes in with a general Exhortation backing all this, that ≈øeeing there is this good comes by adding grace to grace, and ≈øeeing there wil be this evil if you do it not, he brings all home by a practical inference, in the words of my Text, <hi>Wherefore, Brethren, give all diligence to make your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Election ≈øure.</hi>

               <p>Fir≈øt, For the <hi>Demon≈øtrations</hi> of it: It appears that in all Soul concernments you ≈øhould put forth a great deal of diligence, by tho≈øe Re≈øemblances that the work belonging to the ≈øalvation of the ≈øould is compared to in Scripture. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes the work of Chri≈øtianity in ≈øaving the ≈øoul is compared to a <hi>race: Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Let us lay a≈øide every weight, and run with patience the race that is ≈øet before us.</hi> So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24, 25. When you walk in your Gardens or Galleries, you take no pains; but when you run a race, you labour and ≈øtrive hard, and put forth all your ≈øtrength to attain the end. Why (Beloved) matters about the Soul, they are compared to the running of a race; to ≈øhew, what labours and endeavours you mu≈øt put forth in all imployments of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is compared to <hi>wre≈øtling, Eph.</hi> 6.12. <hi>We wre≈øtle not again≈øt fle≈øh and bloud, but again≈øt Principalities and Powers.</hi> And ≈øo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. An allu≈øion to the <hi>Olympick</hi> games, and publick pa≈øtimes, when men wre≈øtled before the common multitude, wherein they put forth all their ≈øtrength and skill to throw each other down: To note, that Chri≈øtianity is

               <p n="3">3.

Now when men are fighting for their lives, what care, and what labour, and what diligence do they put forth to ≈øave them≈øelves? And the work of Chri≈øtianity in the concernments of the Soul is ≈øet forth by this re≈øemblance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is compared to one being in an Agonie; <hi>Luke</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ≈øtrait gate;</hi> The word in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now for the Rea≈øons, Why you mu≈øt be thus diligent in the matters of Chri≈øtianitie. I ≈øhall lay down Ten.</p>

Though you put forth never ≈øo much diligence in the matters of your ≈øoul, all tho≈øe acts you do, are none or them meritorious: you do not get heaven for praying, nor get heaven for reading, nor get heaven for hearing, though haply you get not heaven without it.
<note place="margin">Cau≈øae ≈øine quibus non.</note> Good works, they may be cau≈øes of Salvation in this ≈øen≈øe, Cau≈øes without which you cannot be ≈øaved; but all your obedience, and all your diligence are no cau≈øes for which you are ≈øaved, or which may any way move God to ≈øave you. So that though you are never ≈øo diligent, this diligence is not meritorious at all: Why? Becau≈øe to make it meritorious, ≈øay Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, three things mu≈øt concur; Fir≈øt, The thing mu≈øt be done <hi>freely,</hi> not as a debt. Secondly, It mu≈øt be done <hi>with a mans own native and proper ≈øtrength,</hi> and not a horrowed power. Thirdly, It mu≈øt be done <hi>perfectly.</hi> And therefore Divines ≈øay, (and that upon good rea≈øon too) That all our obedience, and all our actings in the wayes of grace cannot be meritorious: Why?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:115140:13"/>Becau≈øe <hi>(Fir≈øt)</hi> We do them not as a free gift, but as a due debt: we owe God this diligence, and owe him this dutie; and therefore cannot merit, becau≈øe we onely pay God his due. If you lend a man money, will you thank and reward him to pay you your own? No: it is your due, he ought to repay you. All duties in matters of the ≈øoul are Gods due, of right belonging to him, and therefore cannot be meritorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This diligence, could you put it forth by your own ≈øtrength, you had ≈øomewhat wherein to boa≈øt; but all your diligence is put forth by a borrowed ≈øtrength, by a ≈øtrength derived from Je≈øus Chri≈øt, by a ≈øtrength from the Covenant of grace; it is thence you fetch power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all acts of obedience, and ≈øpiritual diligence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It cannot merit, becau≈øe it is not perfect: nay, you are ≈øo far from meriting by your obedience, that you merit nothing but hell for the defects in your obedience, and the imperfections that are remaining in your be≈øt ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>

Take this Caution, That though all the diligence you can put forth cannot be meritorious for God to ≈øave you; yet take this for truth, that the more you abound in ≈øpiritual indu≈øtrie in the matters of the Soul, the more likely you are to receive fuller income of joy, and fuller in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe of grace in your ≈øouls: <hi>To him that hath ≈øhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and it ≈øhall be given him much more abundantly:</hi> That is, to him that hath improved his graces, and u≈øed them wel, they ≈øhall be given more abundantly: <hi>Thou ha≈øt been faithful in a little, thou ≈øhalt be ruler over much.</hi> The more you act, and the more diligent you are in the matters of your ≈øoul, the more likely you are to be eminent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øing in grace above others. It is a note that an Author hath upon the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul. Pual</hi> was the mo≈øt eminent of all the Apo≈øtles; no Apo≈øtle like <hi>Paul,</hi> none out≈øtript him. Now Divines ask the rea≈øon, why <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øhould be more eminent then the re≈øt of the Apo≈øtles, who ≈øaw Chri≈øt in the fle≈øh; whereas <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaw him onely in a vi≈øion, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115140:14"/>no where el≈øe; yet <hi>Paul</hi> was more eminent then any other Apo≈øtle? and they give this rea≈øon: <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>in labours more abundant; Paul</hi> was more indu≈øtrious, putting out his gifts and graces, and God did ble≈ø≈øe that indu≈øtry with a fuller increa≈øe of the graces of Gods Spirit then others had: So that, though God gives us not heaven for our growth in grace; yet ordinarily God intails a greater mea≈øure and increa≈øe of gifts upon the wel u≈øing of them while we are in the world: <hi>Open your mouthes wide, and God will fill them.</hi> The more wide we are in our de≈øires and expectations, the more we ≈øhall be filled.</p>

For Reprehen≈øion: Is it ≈øo, that in all matters of ≈øoul concernment we ≈øhould put forth a great deal of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence? then this ≈øhould be a great ≈øcourge to that ≈ølug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øhne≈ø≈øe of ≈øpirit that mo≈øt men in the world are guilty of.

               <p>It is the Ob≈øervation of a Rabbi, That the Snail above all other creatures, was by God pronounced unclean, becau≈øe of its ≈ølow and ea≈øie pace: God looks upon thee as an unclean man, and an unclean woman, that ha≈øt a ≈øluggi≈øh and a ≈ølow ≈øpirit in matters of Chri≈øtianity. There are many men that like no life like an idle life; they are never wearie ≈øo much, as they are wearie of doing good, and wearie of duties; an hour at a Sermon, a day at a Fa≈øt, a

               <p n="2">2. It is ≈øaid in the de≈øcription, that Effectual Calling, it changes the heart, <hi>whereby God works a wonderful change in the heart:</hi> but an external Calling no way reacheth the heart, only worketh ≈øome kind of civil or common altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the life.</p>

               <p>Fir≈øt, You may be a≈ø≈øured of your effectual Calling, if God hath taken that method with your ≈øouls, which he doth ordinarily take with tho≈øe, whom he doth effectually call.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the Lord hath wrought in you tho≈øe ≈øaving effects or concomitants, which do ordinarily accompanie tho≈øe that are thus effectually called: if the≈øe two things be done, you may have a ≈øeal, and a≈ø≈øurance in your own hearts, that you al≈øo are effectually called. Beloved, it is not for Mini≈øters to flatter you: there are among many in the world, but few that are called; among many that are called, but few elected; and therefore do not flatter your ≈øelves. If upon trial you find you are not in the number of Gods Called ones, go home and bewail your unregerie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unconverted e≈øtate. But before I can ≈øpeak of this method, I mu≈øt fir≈øt lay down ≈øome mi≈øtakes, that are held by erroneous minds about the method God takes in calling a ≈øinner home to him≈øelf.</p>
               <p>A fir≈øt mi≈øtake is of the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> who hold this, that a man is able to call and convert him≈øelf. Now this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth quite exclude and ju≈øtle out God from having any hand therein: they ≈øay, A Chri≈øtian is able to call and convert him≈øelf, having only a general concurrence and a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>Arminians;</hi> and they hold this, That Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Calling con≈øi≈øts only in moral per≈øwa≈øions, and may be re≈øi≈øted by the per≈øon that is thus called; and that a man being called into a ≈øtate of grace, may fall from his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and fall from his grace, and ≈øo have no profit by his Calling at all; which is a mo≈øt uncomfortable opinion; and ≈øurely God would never take this method in calling of his people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That of the <hi>Papi≈øts;</hi> &amp; they ≈øay, That God cals &amp; ordains a ≈øinner to glorie, but it is upon the fore≈øight of his good
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115140:19"/>works. God fore≈øaw how good and holie the man would be, and therefore God would chu≈øe and call him to glorie. But this hath no ground from Scripture nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That of the <hi>Famili≈øts;</hi> and they hold this, That Gods method in calling a ≈øinner is not by the outward Mini≈øtrie of the word, but it is by raptures and revelations, and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in≈øpirations, and extraordinarie waies of working: but this is not Gods u≈øual method, though God ≈øometimes take this way, as he did by <hi>Paul,</hi> who was called this way after an extraordinarie manner: Yet this is not Gods odina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie rule.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is another Mi≈øtake, and that is of tho≈øe who pre≈øs a nece≈ø≈øitie of ≈øuch mea≈øures of legal horrour and terror upon the con≈øciences of men, el≈øe they can never be ≈øaved. Sometimes Mini≈øters have been ≈øo har≈øh now and then, (though indeed no ≈øuch cau≈øe to blame them as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) yet ≈øometimes la≈øhes break out, that men mu≈øt be ≈øo and ≈øo humbled, in ≈øuch a mea≈øure, and ≈øo long for durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now this is not Gods method to pre≈øs for mea≈øure, but a great mi≈øtake about Gods manner of calling a ≈øinner; though I mu≈øt confe≈øs, this is the neare≈øt of all the five, to that rule God takes in calling a ≈øinner to glorie. Having thus laid down the mi≈øtakes, 'tis the ea≈øier now to find out the truth. I come now to ≈øpeak of that method God takes in calling a ≈øinner. And here I ≈øhall lay down a ≈øixfold method, in which God proceeds with tho≈øe whom he doth effectually call, which if he doth ≈øo with you, you may go home with a ≈øeal upon your hearts, that you are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called to grace, and you ≈øhall one day come to glorie.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, When God goes about effectually to call a poor ≈øinner into a ≈øtate of grace, he puts a clear light into his ≈øoul, whereby he may ≈øee the hainous and aggravated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all his ≈øins, more then ever he did before. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8, 8, 13. <hi>Paul</hi> tels you, <hi>Before the commandment came, he was alive, and ≈øin was dead;</hi> that is, before the power of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115140:19"/>the word came upon his con≈øcience to convert him, he was alive; <hi>i, e.</hi> he thought he was a good man, and a ju≈øt man, and he thought ≈øin was dead, ≈øin was de≈øtroied; he never knew ≈øin ≈øo ≈øinful: <hi>but when the commandment came ≈øin revived, and I died:</hi> but when the word of God came with power upon my con≈øcience, and light upon my judgment, then I ≈øaw I was a dead man, ≈øin had kild me, and I ≈øaw ≈øin was raigning, and ≈øin was raging in me: and what then? ver. 13. <hi>I ≈øaw ≈øin exceeding ≈øinful:</hi> he never ≈øaw ≈øin ≈øo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conver≈øion, before his Call, when he was a <hi>Phari≈øee;</hi> but when the word of God came with power upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience to call him, then ≈øaith he, <hi>I ≈øaw ≈øin to be exceeding ≈øinful.</hi> Now (O Beloved) hath ever God done thus with your ≈øouls? may be you look upon ≈øin with a tran≈øient and general view, but do you look upon ≈øin ≈øo as to ≈øee more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in ≈øin then ever you ≈øaw before? This is the cour≈øe God u≈øually takes. Me thinks God deals with a converted ≈øinner, as it is ≈øpoken in <hi>Job</hi> 33.27, 28. <hi>He looketh upon men, and if any ≈øay, I have ≈øinned, and perverted that which was right, and it doth not profit me, he will deliver his ≈øoul from going down into the pit, and his life ≈øhall ≈øee the light:</hi> that is, God looks upon the ma≈øs of mankind in the world, and ≈øaith, if any man ≈øay he hath ≈øinned, and it did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him, that is, if he look upon ≈øin as an evil, and that he never did get good by it: then ≈øaith God, I will deliver his ≈øoul from hel, and bring him to heaven.</p>

Now, O Beloved, to how many do I ≈øpeak this day with: whom God hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taken this Method, ≈øince they were born into the world? How many are there that have been told of their drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenne≈øs, and told of their lu≈øts, and of their deceits, and of their licentious living from day to day; and yet to this day they never ≈øaw ≈øin to be exceeding ≈øinfull; they never were convinced of ≈øin to purpo≈øe? If they did indeed ≈øee their ≈øin, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it was but a tran≈øient ≈øight, ≈øoon come and ≈øoon gone; or el≈øe 2. it was but a general ≈øight, to ≈øay we are all ≈øinners<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> or 3. If they did ≈øee their ≈øin, it was but a confu≈øed ≈øight; no way di≈øtinct: or 4. If they did ≈øee ≈øin, it was an unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ≈øight; the ≈øight of ≈øin did never humble them in Gods ≈øight. I intreat you, Beloved, do not laie hold or have hopes of being effectually call'd, if God hath not ≈øhewn you the hainous and aggravated nature of your ≈øins. There is a ≈øpeech, <hi>Job.</hi> 36.9, 10. <hi>He fir≈øt ≈øhews to men their works, and their tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, that they have exceeded; and then he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens their ears to di≈øcipline, and commands them to return from evil.</hi> Mark, then the Lord doth it, when he makes them ≈øee their tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, that they have exceeded; Now, Have you ≈øeen that you have exceeded in your Pa≈ø≈øions, and in your Pride? have you ≈øeen ≈øin to be exceeding ≈øinful? this is Gods fir≈øt work; and happie are you that are brought into Chri≈øts School, that Chri≈øt doth take this Method withall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After God hath put a light into the ≈øoul, to make you ≈øee the ≈øin fulne≈ø≈øe of ≈øin; then 2. God fa≈øtens the≈øe thoughts on the ≈øoul, to make you ≈øen≈øible of the great mi≈øery that your ≈øins have brought you into; to cry out with <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.24. <hi>Wretched man that I am, who ≈øhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> There <hi>Paul</hi> cryes out of his wretchedne≈ø≈øe and mi≈øery, by rea≈øon of that body of death, the ≈øinfulne≈ø≈øe of his nature, which he confe≈ø≈øes did as much trouble him,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115140:20"/>as if a dead body ≈øhould be tyed to his living body; alluding to the cu≈øtome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in puni≈øhing notorious Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, which he takes to be a mo≈øt grievous puni≈øhment. Why Beloved, have you ever ≈øeen this? did you ever ≈øee that mi≈øery that ≈øin brought upon you? that ≈øin did deve≈øt you of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, did rob you of your God, bani≈øh you from his pre≈øence, intitle you to hell and make you objects of his wrath? Now were you ≈øen≈øible of this mi≈øery? this is Gods method, to make you ≈øee your mi≈øery by rea≈øon of ≈øin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God puts the ≈øoul into a kind of ≈øpirituall a≈øtoni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the poor ≈øinner doth not know where to goe, what cour≈øe to take, which way to turn, how he may get pardon for his ≈øin, and recoverie from his mi≈øerie. This you find mentioned as Gods method, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. upon 3000 at once, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ≈øhall we do to be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> They were even in a maze, the word wrought upon them, and they ≈øaw Je≈øus Chri≈øt crucified to be their ≈øin; and now they crie out in great a≈øtoni≈øhment, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ≈øhall we do to be ≈øaved?</hi> When God effectually calls a man, he will leave him a little to him≈øelf, that he knows not which way in the world to turn him. Now when I ≈øpeak of ≈øpiritual A≈øtoni≈øhment, mi≈øtake me not; for Fir≈øt, I pre≈øs not ≈øuch a mea≈øure of Humiliation, nor ≈øuch a mea≈øure of trouble of mind, how great it mu≈øt be; Nor Secondly do I pre≈øs the duration of it; how long it mu≈øt be; that you mu≈øt be ≈øo long and ≈øo long. Nor Thirdly, doe I pre≈øs an ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute nece≈øsitie of this, as if a man could not be call'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Indeed, we read of <hi>Lydia, that her heart was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and ≈øhe never troubled nor a≈øtoni≈øht; and God ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times works thus in an extraordinarie way: but I pre≈øs this, that ordinarily, its Gods Method in ≈øome mea≈øure or other, at ≈øome time or other, to put his people into ≈øuch a plunge, that they ≈øhall not know which way in the world to turne them≈øelves. And ≈øo were tho≈øe 3000 <hi>Acts</hi> 2. They could not tell what they ≈øhould do to be ≈øaved.</p>
               <p>And here further, if you ask me, With whom doth God
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115140:21"/>mo≈øt of all take this cour≈øe, to put them into ≈øuch ≈øpirituall amazement; to put them into horror and terror about their everla≈øting e≈øtate? I An≈øwer, fir≈øt, Tho≈øe that have liv'd in a cour≈øe of profanene≈øs before Conver≈øion; let them look to it: if thou ha≈øt been a knottie and ≈øtout-hearted ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner again≈øt God, God mu≈øt give thee many a blow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can hammer thee to his own will. You that have been guiltie of Drunkenne≈øs, and guiltie of Adultery, or guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Sabbath-breaking in a gro≈øs and licencious way, that have made this world a ≈øtage to act wickedne≈ø≈øe upon, look to it; boa≈øt not of your Calling: if God hath not brought you in this way, you have ground to ≈øu≈øpect, you are not yet call'd. They that before Conver≈øion were loo≈øe in their lives, if they find not this ≈øpirituall amazement, it is not likely they are call'd. And therefore I verily ≈øu≈øpect your Call, that can jump out of a cour≈øe of Profanene≈ø≈øe, into a cour≈øe of Profe≈ø≈øion; that can jump from a cour≈øe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignitie to delight to hear Sermons, and love Mini≈øters. You that have been oppo≈øers of godline≈øs, if you do not ≈øhew an eminent work in your Conver≈øion, I greatly ≈øu≈øpect, whether you are converted or no: becau≈øe it is Gods u≈øuall Method, if men have been men of gro≈øs lives before cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to bring them to great a≈øtoni≈øhment when they are called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You that have often with≈øtood, and ≈øtill with≈øtand Gods call; that Sermon after Sermon, and invitation after invitation would not gain upon you; Do you look about you; God will give you many a blow, God will ≈øend you many a ≈øad houre, before he brings you to your peace.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>Fir≈øt, A man effectually call'd by Chri≈øt, he doth unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly love the word of God, and the Mini≈øter that preached that word that God did u≈øe as an in≈øtrument of his call. Fir≈øt, I ≈øay, he will love the word, <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that is of God,</hi> (that is, he that is call'd by God) <hi>heareth Gods word, therefore you are not of God, becau≈øe you heare not his word.</hi> There the Scripture tels us, that they who are of God, effectually called by him, they heare his word with abundance of delight; and abundance of joy and love. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>He that is of God heareth us, he that is not of God heareth not us.</hi> And therefore <hi>David,</hi> when he would evidence a work of God upon his heart, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.14. <hi>Thy word,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>is as great riches to me.</hi> And as if he did not value riches comparable to the word, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 72. <hi>I love thy word above thou≈øands of gold, and ≈øilver.</hi> Beloved, if you are converted and called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, you will love the Word of God, that was an in≈øtrument of your Call.

What's the rea≈øon one man will ri≈øe early, go far, take pains, and many times neglect his own lawfull affairs, and all to enjoy the Word: when another man will goe by the Church-door, and haply go to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and will not go to hear the Word at all? What's the rea≈øon? One is call'd by the Word, and the other not: one is called by the Word, and therefore loves it; another is not called, and that makes him neglect it.</p>

And it is called a <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light,</hi> 1. Becau≈øe it is marvellous if you compare that knowledg you ≈øhall have under the Go≈øpel, with what men had under the Law. 2. It is marvellous, becau≈øe men are a≈øtoni≈øh'd, that they ≈øhould, after ≈øo long a night of ignorance, come to ≈øo great a mea≈øure of knowledg. 3.

               <p>Now this call from darkne≈ø≈øe to light hath two Branches: 1. A man ≈øhall have more light, to have more acquaintance with, and more clearne≈ø≈øe in the my≈øteries of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: And 2. more light to know the ≈øinfulne≈ø≈øe of him≈øelf.</p>

                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> He ≈øhall have more light to know the my≈øteries of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: And hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115140:24"/>
                  <hi>It plea≈øed God to call me by his grace, and to reveal his Son in me;</hi> implying, that where God by his grace doth call a ≈øinner, he doth reveal his Son unto him. Wherefore, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, if Je≈øus Chri≈øt be not made known to your ≈øouls, if you have no competent mea≈øure of the knowledg of Chri≈øt; you may be under this conviction, that you are not yet called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Nay further, he doth not onely call you unto this light, to manife≈øt Je≈øus Chri≈øt to you in ≈øome dim way; but you ≈øhall have a clear light: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>For God who commanded light to ≈øhine out of darkne≈ø≈øe, hath ≈øhined in our hearts</hi> (not in a dim, but ≈øhining light) <hi>to give us the light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Je≈øus Chri≈øt:</hi> that is, you have a cleer light to know God in the face of Chri≈øt; you cannot know God in him≈øelf, but in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of Chri≈øt you ≈øhall have light to know him. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the fir≈øt Branch, That God will put a light into thy ≈øoul, whereby thou ≈øhalt have a clear knowledg of the things appertaining to Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>Secondly,</hi> This light ≈øhall not onely reveal Chri≈øt to thee; but this light ≈øhall al≈øo reveal thy Self to thee, the ≈øinfulne≈ø≈øe of thy ≈øelf. It is ob≈øervable of <hi>Paul,</hi> that before his calling, <hi>he was after the law blamele≈ø≈øe;</hi> he thought him≈øelf to be a faultle≈ø≈øe man; but when the word called him, then he cryes out, <hi>I ≈øee ≈øin to be exceeding ≈øinfull:</hi> then he ≈øaw ≈øin to be ≈øin, and him≈øelf to be a vile and wretched man. And therefore, Beloved, any of you that have not this <hi>marvellous light</hi> in your ≈øouls, neither to know God, nor know Je≈øus Chri≈øt, nor the matters appertaining to him, nor to know the ≈øinfulne≈ø≈øe of your own hearts; take it from God, you are not effectually called: either the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages in Scripture mu≈øt be ra≈øed out, or el≈øe your call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mu≈øt not be ≈øound; and therefore take heed: I would fain make my Mini≈øtrie ≈øearching, that hypocrites may not lie lurking under it. You would be better Chri≈øtians, if you were better acquainted with all that un≈øoundne≈ø≈øe, and that wretchedne≈ø≈øe of heart that is in you; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I intreat you) look about you: Though I would have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115140:24"/>no godly man di≈øcouraged by this that is ≈øpoken; but that you that are not yet called, might have your hearts a little ≈øtaggered by what is and will be ≈øaid.</p>

Beloved, there are many that hear the word, yet never go out of them≈øelves, and never clo≈øe in with Chri≈øt: yea but all they that heare and learne, that hear and are called by hearing, they all come in to Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Wherefore all you, that in hearing cannot find your hearts in love with Chri≈øt, cannot find your hearts to clo≈øe in with Chri≈øt, and believe in Chri≈øt; you have ju≈øt cau≈øe to ≈øu≈øpect your Call, that your calling is not effectual. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. The Apo≈øtle tels you, there were other men <hi>counted Chri≈øt fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe; but to you that are called, Chri≈øt is the power and wi≈øedome of God:</hi> that is, you do acknowledg, and you do conceive of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, that he hath as much power as God hath in him, and as much wi≈øedome as God hath in him; and you clo≈øe in with Chri≈øt for that end, when other men think Chri≈øt to be fooli≈øh, and Chri≈øt weak; men uncall'd, they have low thoughts of Chri≈øt; <hi>but to you that are call'd, Chri≈øt is the power and wi≈øedome of God:</hi> You will have high thoughts of Je≈øus Chri≈øt if you are effectually called.</p>

Thus was <hi>Paul,</hi> hee ≈øpeaks with indignation again≈øt the ≈øins he was guilty of before his calling; <hi>I have been a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecutor,</hi> I have hal'd the Saints into pri≈øon; Nay, ≈øaith hee, <hi>I was even mad again≈øt the Church.</hi> Beloved, you will count your ≈øins to be madne≈ø≈øe, and count them to be greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, that were committed before God call'd you. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelm</hi> ≈øaid to his body, I'le tame thee, O unruly bea≈øt, with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting

                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.9.</note> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>according to the purpo≈øe of his grace; not according to your own works.</hi> O live, live in magnifying that grace that hath called you.</p>
               <p>And here I might pre≈ø≈øe upon you 7 or 8 Con≈øiderations, why you ≈øhould live in magnifying of grace. I ≈øhal name them fir≈øt in general. This exhortation ≈øhould much ≈øway with you, if you would con≈øider the≈øe three things, 1. From what you are called. 2. To what you are called; and 3. For what you are called. I ≈øhall put the two fir≈øt together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Con≈øideration of this, from what, and to what you are called; ≈øhould much heighten your magnifying of Gods grace: And here I ≈øhall name ≈øeven particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man effectually called, he is called from ignorance to knowledg, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>You are called from darkne≈ø≈øe, into marvellous light.</hi> Now ≈øhould not this make you magnifie mercy, that you that lay in your ≈øins uncalled, as in a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of darkne≈ø≈øe; now God ≈øhould call you into a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome and plea≈øurable palace? thy mind was as a fair buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hou≈øe without windows: or if any, but woodden win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, that would let in no light; now God hath opened the≈øe ≈øhutts, and let in the Sun of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe to ≈øhine upon thy ≈øoul; and brought thee from this dungeon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe in thy ≈øoul; and given thee the light of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You are called from a cour≈øe of ≈øin, to a cour≈øe of holine≈ø≈øe. Before your calling you were the Divels Drudges, and did his work at will; the Divel (in <hi>Pauls</hi> language to <hi>Timothy</hi>), had you <hi>Captive at his plea≈øure,</hi> but when God cals you, he takes you from under the dominion and raign of ≈øin; and brings you into a cour≈øe of holine≈øs. 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 4.7. <hi>You are called, not unto uncleanne≈øs, but unto holine≈øs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He hath called us to glory and vertue.</hi> Before calling, thou wert the receptacle or common ≈øhore of all filth and uncleanne≈ø≈øe; when called, thou art ≈øwept with the be≈øome of Sanctification; yea beautified and adorned as a plea≈øant palace for thy God to delight in. And this ≈øhould cau≈øe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115140:28"/>you much to magnifie grace, that you are brought from being the Divels drudges, to be Gods freemen; from being the Divels ≈ølaves, to be Gods ≈øervants; from being the Divels taskeman, to pay thee thy wages in hell; to be Gods workman, for which he wil give thee thy reward in heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God cals thee from bondage to libertie. In the time that thou art uncalled, thou art in bondage; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. <hi>they are the ≈øervants of Corruption, &amp;c.</hi> in bondage to thy lu≈øts, and bondage to thy Pa≈ø≈øion, and a ≈ølave to the world; thou art in bondage under the Law, under the cau≈øe and rigour, and condemnation of it; but now Je≈øus Chri≈øt, if he have called thee, he hath called thee to libertie. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. <hi>You are called to libertie, only u≈øe not libertie as a Cloak to wickedne≈øs.</hi> Before calling, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, you are <hi>in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans ≈ønares,</hi> but after calling, you are ≈øet at libertie, you are freed from the guilt, and freed from the bondage of your ≈øinne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You are called from a condition of e≈øtrangedne≈ø≈øe, into an intimate familiaritie &amp; fellow≈øhip with Je≈øus Chri≈øt, Before <hi>calling,</hi> you are <hi>Strangers from the life of grace,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈ø. 4.18. You are <hi>without God in the world, ≈øtrangers to the Commonwealth of I≈ørael,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 2.12. But when God <hi>calls</hi> you, he cals you from the condition of a ≈øtranger, and brings you into friend≈øhip and fellow≈øhip with Je≈øus Chri≈øt. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellow≈øhip of his Son:</hi> You who were without Chri≈øt before <hi>calling,</hi> being <hi>called,</hi> you enjoy neer familiaritie with his Son.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You are called from Sathan unto God. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. He hath ≈øent forth his word among you, <hi>to bring you from darkne≈ø≈øe to light, and from the power of Sathan to God.</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, who was thy lord, and was thy ma≈øter, and ruler, thou art now from under his clutches, and brought under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and ≈øubjection of thy God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When God effectually calls thee, thou art brought from a ≈øtate of enmitie again≈øt God, to a ≈øtate of amitie and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115140:28"/>reconciliation towards him, and Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and all the things of God. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, for to this ye are called; and be yee thankeful.</hi> God hath called you to peace, he hath not called you to wrath. Before <hi>Calling,</hi> God and thy ≈øoul were the mo≈øt inveterate enemies in all the world: After <hi>Calling,</hi> God and thou are of enemies become the greate≈øt friends: You are called to peace, therefore be thankful.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You are called from a ≈øtate of ≈øhame to a ≈øtate of glory. Before you are called you are vile and ≈øhameful creatures in Gods ≈øight; when God cals you, he cals you into a condition of glory. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Who hath called us to his eternal glory:</hi> and 1 The≈ø. 2.12. <hi>Since thou wa≈øt precious in my ≈øight, and I have loved thee, thou became≈øt honourable,</hi> I≈øa 43. 1 Pet. 2.6. <hi>To you that believe, Chri≈øt is precious:</hi> or as it is in the Greek,

                  <hi>he is an honour to you.</hi> Je≈øus Chri≈øt, when once you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a believing ≈øtate, he is not onely precious to you, and prized of you; but he is an honour to you. This then you are to con≈øider, that <hi>uncalled,</hi> you are in a ≈øhamefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, no badg of honour lies upon you; but when once you are <hi>called</hi> by Chri≈øt, he becomes an honour to you.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And la≈øtly, (which ≈øhall be accompli≈øhed in the end) you ≈øhall be called from earth to heaven, and from the grave to glory; this ≈øhall be your call after death. Now put all the≈øe Eight together: To be called from ignorance to knowledg; from ≈øin to grace, from bondage to liberty; from e≈øtrangement to fellow≈øhip with Je≈øus Chri≈øt; from a ≈øtate of enmitie to a ≈øtate of amitie and reconciliation with God and man; from ≈øhame to glorie; and from earth to heaven: and ≈øhould not this mightily highten your joy, and greaten your prai≈øes in magnifying the grace of God in your hearts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Again, The con≈øideration of this, As, <hi>From what,</hi> and <hi>To what;</hi> ≈øo, <hi>For what you are called,</hi> ≈øhould grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your prai≈øes. Now <hi>for what</hi> are you called? You are called meerly according to the <hi>purpo≈øe of his owne grace;</hi> neither fore≈øeen works, nor good education, nor grace in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115140:29"/>you, none of all the≈øe were motives in Gods bre≈øt to call you. And hence you may ≈øee it was nothing in you, becau≈øe there were many things in us might move God not to call us: We have often with≈øtood his call; we have often ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled the motions of his Spirit in our hearts; we have often carried gain ≈øaying hearts to the wooings of the Mini≈øters of Chri≈øt: So that it is nothing in us, but meerly his own grace that conquers our unholine≈ø≈øe, and conquers our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingne≈ø≈øe, and overcomes that ≈øtoutne≈ø≈øe of heart that is in us; meerly the grace and goodne≈ø≈øe of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Now ≈øumm up all the≈øe together, and revolve them in your hearts, and you will ≈øee what great cau≈øe you have to live in magnifying of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ten con≈øolatorie Conclu≈øions to all tho≈øe men that are effectually called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and mixing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øions procuring terror to the wicked, with ≈øuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure comfort to the godly; one tempered with the other may do good to both. I begin with the fir≈øt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The fir≈øt ≈øad Conclu≈øion I ≈øhal lay down is this; That there are many men in the world, that are called outwardly by the word unto a profe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt, that are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led effectually by the ≈øpirit to a po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt. My meaning is this; There are many men have the word of God working much upon them, to the changing of their lives, altering their cour≈øe, and new moulding of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an external profe≈ø≈øion; that yet notwith≈øtanding all this never had ≈øaving grace wrought upon their hearts, which is effectual calling: <hi>Many are called, but few are cho≈øen,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.16. And this is a dreadful Conclu≈øion to all you that are profe≈ø≈øors, that have not a ≈øaving work upon your hearts; to you that flock unto the mini≈øtry of the word, yet are not called thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they who are called outwardly by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word to a profe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt, and yet not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led inwardly by the ≈øpirit, they ≈øhall endure greater dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and greater torments in hell, then tho≈øe that never heard a word of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8 12. <hi>Many ≈øhall come</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>from the Ea≈øt and from the We≈øt, and ≈øhal ≈øit down with Abraham, I≈øaak, and Jacob, in the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> and what then? <hi>but the children of the Kingdome ≈øhall be ca≈øt out into utter darkne≈ø≈øe, where ≈øhall be weeping, and wailing, and gna≈øhing of Teeth.</hi> Now, who are meant here by the children of the kingdome? not tho≈øe that have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven prepared for them; but the profe≈ø≈øing Jewes, who are called the children of the kingdome, becau≈øe they enjoyed a greater, and clearer, and fuller mea≈øure of the things of God, which ≈øhewed them the way to the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then other men did. And when Chri≈øt cals them the children of the kingdome, he cals the heathen the children of the world. Now, many of the children of the kingdome
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115140:30"/>≈øhall be ca≈øt into utter darkne≈ø≈øe: If there be any more di≈ømal place then other, it ≈øhall be for the children of the kingdome; tho≈øe that have been as it were nur≈øed up under Gods elbow by ordinances; the children of the kingdome, they ≈øhall have a more di≈ømal portion, and di≈ømal room in hell then other men ≈øhall have, that never enjoyed the ordinances of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And O what a ≈øad word is this to you that live where ordinances do mo≈øt abound, that you may be called the children of the kingdome, and yet you to be thru≈øt into utter darkne≈ø≈øe!</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there are many men, who are only called out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly into a bare profe≈ø≈øion, that do harbour and nouri≈øh pre≈øumptuous per≈øwa≈øions in their own hearts, that they are effectually called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt; when they never had any ≈øaving work of grace upon their hearts. This I ≈øpake of ≈øome weeks agoe, from <hi>John.</hi> 8.41. The Jewes had ≈øtrong per≈øwa≈øions, they had <hi>Abraham</hi> for their father; and when Chri≈øt beats them off from that, they went higher and ≈øaid, we have God to our father; and yet <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 44. Chri≈øt tels them, <hi>they were of their Father the Divell.</hi> And Beloved, you may al≈øo be deceived, in harbouring ≈øtrong per≈øwa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that you are called effectually, when you are only call'd outwardly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That they that are conceited in the opinion of their own goodne≈ø≈øe, without ≈øeeing their want and nece≈ø≈øitie of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; are of all ≈øorts of people in the world mo≈øt unlikely to be effectually called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt. This I urge from <hi>Matt.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I came not,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>to call the righteous,</hi> &amp;c. Mark, who are they? that is, Chri≈øt came not to call the Phari≈øees, who were righteous in their own eyes, and who had a ≈øelfe conceitedne≈ø≈øe that things went well with them; and ≈øaw no need of a Mediator, and Interce≈ø≈øor, and Redeemer; <hi>I came not to call the righteous:</hi> Je≈øus Chri≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that ≈øort of men from being called by him; men that are ≈øelf opinionated, and have a conceit of their own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, without any want of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Wherefore all you that think you have a ≈øtrong faith towards God ever
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115140:30"/>≈øince you were born, that think you live hone≈øtly among your neighbours, pay every man his due, and therefore ≈øee no need of Chri≈øt all your daies; the Lord ≈øhew you mercie; you are more unlikly to be called then any men in the world. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31. There is a parable <hi>of a man that had two ≈øons, hee bid both work in the vineyard; one ≈øon ≈øaid he would not work,</hi> he was ob≈øtinate; <hi>the other ≈øon ≈øaid he would work, but did not,</hi> and ≈øo was wor≈øe then his word. Now the≈øe two ≈øons, they are the emblem of two ≈øorts of men within the pale of the Church; ≈øome are profane and ob≈øtinate men, and they an≈øwer as the fir≈øt ≈øon, and ≈øay, they wil not work: the ≈øecond are profe≈ø≈øing men, men that make a good profe≈ø≈øion, but do not an≈øwer their profe≈ø≈øion in their practice. Now marke; <hi>Whether of the≈øe twain will the father accept? and they ≈øaid unto him, the fir≈øt,</hi> the mo≈øt ob≈øtinate; that ≈øaid, he would not go, but went. <hi>Verily,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>≈øo I ≈øay unto you, Publicans and Harlots ≈øhall go into heaven before you.</hi> Mark, how Chri≈øt applies the parable from their own mouths; you that are Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øees, that are righteous and hone≈øt in your own eyes, I wil ≈øooner call whores, and harlots, and the wor≈øt of men, then I wil call you. <hi>Publicans and Harlots;</hi> Publicans, they were the wor≈øt ≈øort of men that were, they were ≈øitting at the receipt of cu≈øtome, their calling expo≈øing them to a great deal of extortion and briberie, yet the≈øe men ≈øhould go to heaven before others that made a glorious profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Again,</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth ≈øad Conclu≈øion is this, That when others are effectually called before your faces, and yet you remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, this ≈øhould greatly aggravate your ≈øin and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; when (I ≈øay) you ≈øhall ≈øee others that live (haply) in the ≈øame hou≈øe with you, that hear in the ≈øame congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that ≈øit in the ≈øame ≈øeat with you; when you ≈øhall hear the≈øe effectually called, and you remain uncalled; this ≈øhall greatly increa≈øe your ≈øin &amp; damnation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.32. <hi>John came to you in the way of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and you beleeved him not;</hi> (that is, they were not called by his Mini≈øtry)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115140:31"/>what then? <hi>but the Publicans and Harlots believed:</hi> what then? <hi>and you, when you had ≈øeen it, repented not afterwards that you might believe:</hi> Mark how Chri≈øt argues, he urges, that tho≈øe men that heard the ≈øame Sermons that the other men did heare, they were converted; ≈øaith he, you ≈øee whores and harlots converted, (alluding to <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and others) you ≈øee the≈øe, and yet you repent not, and yet you beleeve not: now you ≈øee one, then another; and yet when you ≈øee this, you repent not that you might beleeve. Beloved, This is a ≈øad conclu≈øion to you, that ≈øhall ≈øee others converted, when you that haply lie in the ≈øame bed, ≈øit at the ≈øame board, and hear the ≈øame Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the ≈øame Congregation; yet they ≈øhall be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and called, and you not: this will greatly increa≈øe your ≈øin and condemnation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That whoever God intends effectually to call, it is Gods ordinary way to call them by the Mini≈øtry of his word. 2 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 2.13, 14. Its ≈øaid there, that they were <hi>called through the Sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternall glory by Je≈øus Chri≈øt:</hi> they were called by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the truth, that is, by believing the word preacht, and loving the word preacht; <hi>faith comes by hearing:</hi> faith is the fir≈øt grace in a Chri≈øtians Call, and that comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. ≈øo <hi>Acts</hi> 26.17, 18. When Chri≈øt would call and convert the Gentiles, he doth it not immediately, but he u≈øeth the Mini≈øtry of <hi>Paul: God thou, teach the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and bring them from darkne≈ø≈øe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> God doth it ≈øtill by the preaching of his word. Now this is a ≈øad word to three ≈øorts of men. Fir≈øt, its a ≈øad word to them that never ≈øat under the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preaching of the word, they are out of Gods ordinarie way of being ≈øaved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a ≈øad word to tho≈øe that may enjoy the word, and yet ≈ølight it; they al≈øo are not likely to be called.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its a ≈øad word to tho≈øe that leave the ordinarie way of Gods calling by the preaching of the word, and tru≈øt to raptures, revelations, in≈øpirations, and extraordinary
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115140:31"/>means for God to call them by: alas, they al≈øo are out of Gods ordinarie way of calling, for God ordinarily takes this way to call a ≈øoul by the preaching of his word. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.22. When the Prodigal was effectually called home to his father, his father did not pre≈øently comfort him him≈øelf, but he ≈øends his ≈øervants, and ≈øaid, <hi>Go, take the be≈øt robe, and put it upon my Sonne;</hi> This ≈øon is a ≈øinner, the father is God Almightie, the ≈øervants are the mini≈øters; now God doth not his work by him≈øelf, but he leaves it to his Mini≈øters; and they ≈øhall put on the ring and the garment; they ≈øhall be the in≈øtruments by the Mini≈øtrie of the word to work grace in the heart. Hence 'tis that 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 1.12. Some are blamed that ≈øhould ≈øay, <hi>I am of Paul, and I of Apollo and I of Chri≈øt;</hi> Why, are men blamed for ≈øaying they are for Chri≈øt? Is that blame worthy, to cry up Chri≈øt? No: the fault is not ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in advancing Chri≈øt, but the fault was this, ≈øo to cry up Chri≈øt, as to crie down duties, and crie down the u≈øe of Mini≈øters, and the u≈øe of ordinances, and therein they were to blame; becau≈øe Chri≈øt would not immediately by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and raptures call any, but leaves the conver≈øion and call of a ≈øinner, to the ordinary way of preaching the word: and therefore a ≈øad word it is to all out of Gods way of calling, that either have not the word, or if they have it, never care to enjoy it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That if men continue long under the enjoyment of the word, and are not effectually called by it, they are likely never to be called. I would commend to you that place to prove this, in <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6, 7. where Chri≈øt tels you <hi>of a fig tree, he ≈øtayed three years looking for fruit, and he found none; the husbandman prayed to ≈øpare it one yeare longer, and if it did not bear fruit then, he ≈øhould cut it down, and ca≈øt it into the fire.</hi> Now, this fig tree were the profe≈ø≈øing Jewes, who lay ≈øome competent time under the Mini≈øtrie of Chri≈øt, and of his Apo≈øtles; and this fig-tree, if it were ≈øpared but one year, and brought not forth fruit, then it ≈øhould be cut down: and Chri≈øt did ≈øo, it ≈øeems he cur≈øt it, and ≈øaid, <hi>never fruit grow more upon this tree.</hi> Now, you would ask
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115140:32"/>what the meaning of all this is? Why, Beloved, a fig-tree, if it beareth not fruit within four yeares after it is planted, it is likely never to bring forth fruit: And here the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comes home thus far, that if after ≈øome competencie of time, in which in all likelihood, men may have ≈øome ≈øparkes wrought in them by the mini≈øtrie of the word; if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this they are not converted, the cur≈øe of the fig-tree is like to fall upon that mans heart; never let word do that man good more, and never let grace grow in that mans heart more; <hi>let never fruit grow more upon that tree;</hi> this the Parable holds forth, that if you live under the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the word long, and are not converted, it is an argument you ≈øhall not be called. And this is a heart-cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting con≈øideration to all ancient men, that have out-lived many Mini≈øters, and have ≈øeen their Mini≈øters laid in the Grave; their Mini≈øters have ≈øpent their ≈øtrength, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted their lungs in preaching to them; and yet they are as profane as ever, and as loo≈øe as ever, and as regardle≈øs of God and grace as ever; truely, you are in a very ≈øad ca≈øe if it be thus with you, you are likely never to be called by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That God in the di≈øpen≈øations of his grace, doth not ordinarily let effectual calling run to the richer ≈øort of men in the world;

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115140:32"/>at Je≈øus Chri≈øt; when the poor and ignorant people that knew not the law, they followed him. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 26. <hi>Not many wi≈øe, not many noble, not many mighty are called; but God hath cho≈øen the poor things of this world, and things that are de≈øpi≈øed, yea, and things that are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi> Here you ≈øee plainly this Conclu≈øion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Gods effectuall calling doth not ordinarily and commonly run among the greater ≈øort of men in the world; but it runs among the poorer ≈øort of men, they ordinarily give be≈øt entertainment to the Go≈øpel. And the rea≈øon of this is, 1. To magnifie the riches of his grace; if Chri≈øt ≈øhould call rich men only, and chiefly; many would think, it was only mens riches, and mens honour did move Chri≈øt to call them: Now, Chri≈øt to vindicate and magnifie his grace, he will call poor de≈øpicable wretches, that one would think, there ≈øhould be nothing in the eye of rea≈øon or ≈øen≈øe, why God ≈øhould ca≈øt an eye of favour upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To magnifie and manife≈øt his power, that he will pre≈øerve a companie of poor contemptible people, among ≈øo many enemies, ≈øo potent, and ≈øo wealthie, that they ≈øhall never be able to overthrow them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becau≈øe, rich men lie under more temptations again≈øt effectuall calling, then poor men do. Rich men thinke, ≈øhould I be called to be a Profe≈ø≈øor, I may lo≈øe my riches, endanger my e≈øtate, and eclip≈øe my honour; and the≈øe are great temptations to rich men to hinder their calling. Therefore you read <hi>Mark</hi> 10.22. of the young man; that when Chri≈øt called him, it is ≈øaid, <hi>he went away ≈øorrowfull, for he had great po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions;</hi> and would not follow Chri≈øt, who had not a hou≈øe wherein to put his head. Many men for fear of lo≈øing their e≈øtates, they lie under this ≈øore temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to hinder them from being called: And then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo for their honour; men may think they ≈øhall eclip≈øe their honor, ≈øhould they profe≈øs a cour≈øe of Religion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I preacht publikely among the ordinarie ≈øort,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Paul, but</hi> I preach <hi>privately to men of reputation, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="9">9. If you are only externally called to a profe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt, and not called internally to a po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of him; at one time or other before you die, God will di≈øcover the hypocrifie of your hearts, and the un≈øoundne≈øs of your Call. There are many men who now are called; a man cannot di≈øcern whether they be effectually called or no; but in likelihood before you die, you will di≈øcover ≈øomewhat or other that may give ju≈øt ground of ≈øu≈øpicion, you are not ≈øavingly called; either by falling into ≈øome error in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or running into ≈øome ≈øcandalous ≈øin, or the like.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, If God hath not, or intends not effectually to call thee, thou maie≈øt take this for an undeniable truth, God neither intends to ju≈øtifie thee, nor to ≈øave thee: <hi>whom he cals, them he ju≈øtifies,</hi> and none el≈øe; <hi>and whom he ju≈øtifies, them he glorifies,</hi> and none el≈øe: So that Ju≈øtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Glorification depends upon calling; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. And thus I have done with the≈øe ten ≈øad Conclu≈øions.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall now change my di≈øcour≈øe, and turn my ≈øpeech to a ≈øecond ≈øort of men; and to them I ≈øhall lay down ten con≈øolatory Conclu≈øions, for the comfort of you that are the called of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And here, before I lay the≈øe down, I ≈øhall fir≈øt ≈øhew you what need there is that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters ≈øhould preach comfortably to you that are effectually called. Becau≈øe fir≈øt, after you are called effectually, you are more expo≈øed to meet with per≈øecutions from men. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Temptations from the Divel. Thirdly, The ≈øtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ≈øtrugling of Corruptions from within, then ever you were before; therefore you had need of comfort.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ≈øay, After calling you are more expo≈øed to meet with per≈øecutions from men, then ever you were before. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32, 33. <hi>Call to remembrance the former daies, in which after you were illuminated, you endured a ≈øore fight of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115140:33"/>affliction, partly by being reproached, and made a gazing ≈øtock &amp;c.</hi> They endured nothing before, but after they were inlightned, they endured a great fight of Affliction: had not you therefore need of comfort?</p>
               <p n="2">2. After Calling, you are more expo≈øed to temptations from the Divel, then ever you were before. The Divel, when he finds all things at peace, he lets men alone; but when he finds a man coming out of his clutches to be called, then Satan troubles and a≈ø≈øaults him. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8, 10. <hi>Your Adver≈øarie the Divel goes about like a roaring Lion, ≈øeeking whom he may devour.</hi> The≈øe were they that <hi>the God of grace had called to eternall glory.</hi> Yet the≈øe were they that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel rageth ≈øo again≈øt; Had not you therfore need of comfort, becau≈øe you are expo≈øed to more Temptations from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel?</p>
               <p>And 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, You are to meet with more ≈øtrong and vigorous workings of inward Corruptions in your own hearts; as <hi>Paul,</hi> before his calling was not troubled with his Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ≈øinne never troubled him; the powerful and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous workings of his lu≈øts never wearied him; <hi>but when the command came, then ≈øin revived:</hi> When the power of the word came with Authoritie upon his Con≈øcience, then he ≈øaw ≈øinne to revive and get ≈øtrength upon him. Beloved, I would appeal to any of you, whom God hath called to grace and glory, whether before you were called, you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found ≈øinne ≈øo ≈øtrong as after, and ever found the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of your inward corruptions ≈øo violent as after? and therefore upon the≈øe three grounds, you have need that comfort ≈øhould be preached unto you.</p>
               <p>I now pa≈ø≈øe to the Conclu≈øions, which I ≈øhall lay down for the comfort of all them that are effectually called.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Je≈øus Chri≈øt doth effectually call a poor ≈øinner, before that ≈øinner doth look after Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Should God intail heaven upon this condition, that you that had been fir≈øt in the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, ≈øhould be fir≈øt in ≈øeeking reconciliation, we ≈øhould never have the difference ended betwixt God and us; but behold, here is mercy, and here

And O what comfort is this? Chri≈øt doth not ≈øtay till thou look after a Chri≈øt; but Chri≈øt ca≈øts an eye upon thee before thou look after him. We read of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> the Publican, that while he was looking after his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at the receipt of cu≈øtome, at that time Je≈øus Chri≈øt was looking after his ≈øoul. We read of the Di≈øciples of Chri≈øt, whil≈øt they were mending their nets, and looking after their fi≈øh, Je≈øus Chri≈øt takes this occa≈øion with the Hook of the Go≈øpel to catch them. We read of <hi>Paul,</hi> that whil≈øt he was breathing out per≈øecution again≈øt the Church of God, and raging with malice again≈øt the Saints of God; at that time he was even called to be a Saint: So that this is very comfortable. God doth fir≈øt look after a ≈øinner in his effectual calling, before a ≈øinner looks out after Chri≈øt. God doth fir≈øt look after thee, inlightning thee by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ≈øeizing upon thy con≈øcience by a command, before thou look after him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath effectually called thee, when he hath left many thou≈øands in the world, of better parts, and better di≈øpo≈øitions, more naturall good, and le≈øs evill in them then thou ha≈øt in thy ≈øelf; and yet he hath reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them and called thee. Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath many times rejected a patient heathen, when he hath called thee, who art of a pa≈ø≈øionate and rigid di≈øpo≈øition. Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath left many a curious wit, and pregnant Scholar, and many of ≈øingular parts that had they grace to manage them, they might bring God much glory; and it may be he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee, a poor ignorant ≈øotti≈øh creature. Je≈øus Chri≈øt (it may be) hath rejected many that have had le≈øs
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115140:34"/>≈øinne, then thou ha≈øt in thee. Je≈øus Chri≈øt did reject ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an hone≈øt heathen, when he would call <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> that had ≈øeven Divels in her; Chri≈øt rejected <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and rejected <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a half turned Chri≈øtian; and rejected <hi>Herod,</hi> who heard <hi>John</hi> Bapti≈øt gladly; and rejected <hi>Felix,</hi> that trembled at a Sermon; and rejected <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> that humbled his ≈øoul before God; when it may be, he hath called thee, that never had≈øt ≈øuch workings in thy heart as the≈øe men had: and O what ground of comfort is here?</p>
               <p n="3">3. God in calling thy ≈øoul, and bringing thee into a ≈øtate of grace, he doth it freely for his own names ≈øake; when there was nothing in thee to move him to call thee; when there was much in thee to provoke him never to call thee; yet his own grace compelled him, and his own mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him to cal thee. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. <hi>We are called according to the purpo≈øe of his own grace, not according to our own works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That they who are mo≈øt ≈øenfible of their own vilene≈øs, and ≈øee the mo≈øt want and nece≈ø≈øity of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; they of all people are mo≈øt likely to be called by him. When Chri≈øt rejects civil hone≈øt men, and ≈øelf conceited men, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good men, and they are no way likely to be called; yet tho≈øe men that are ≈øen≈øible of their wickedne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øee their want of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, they are of all men mo≈øt likely to be called. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I came not to call the righteous,</hi> but whom? <hi>but ≈øinners to repentance.</hi> All men are ≈øinners, but he means ≈øuch as ≈øee their ≈øin, and ≈øee their need of Chri≈øt to pardon and ≈øubdue ≈øin in them; for ≈øo the words import: <hi>The whole need not a Phy≈øician, but they that are ≈øick:</hi> They that are ≈øick of ≈øin and ≈øee their infirmities, they are mo≈øt likely to be called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And therefore this is mo≈øt comfortable to you, all you that are drooping Chri≈øtians, that hang down your heads under the ≈øen≈øe of ≈øin, that ≈øee ≈øin to be exceeding ≈øinful; this is the end for which Chri≈øt came into the world, to call you to glory.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That a man may be elected by God from all eternity, and yet he may live a long time in a cour≈øe of ≈øin, before he call him, and yet before he dies, he ≈øhall be called. <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:115140:35"/>10.16. <hi>I laie down my life for my ≈øheep; and other ≈øheep I have, which are not of this fold, them al≈øo I mu≈øt bring, and they ≈øhall hear my voice, and there ≈øhall be one fold under one ≈øhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning is this; Chri≈øt told them, his converted ones were his ≈øheep; and the≈øe are not all; but I have others that are not converted, yet I will convert them, and bring them to the ≈øame fold al≈øo. So that Chri≈øt hath his ≈øheep among them that are not yet converted and called; and though many times you you may go a long time in a cour≈øe of ≈øin, yet before you die, you ≈øhall be effectually called, and brought home to the ≈øheepfold of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A man may be effectually called, when in his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion, he cannot find any real and ≈øound evidence of his vocation. This that Phra≈øe in <hi>Peter</hi> imports, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Who≈øo doth not the≈øe things, is blind and cannot ≈øee afar off.</hi> It is ≈øpoken of a godly man, of a man that hath his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ≈øure, but doth not adde grace to grace to make his calling ≈øure, that man is purblind and cannot ≈øee afar off; that is, cannot ≈øee as far as heaven, that his name is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there; cannot have clear and ≈øtrong comfort of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to God. Many a godly man, may be effectually called, and yet that man a purblind man, not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold as with open face the evidence of his effectuall calling.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A man may have a grounded a≈ø≈øurance that he is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, and yet neither know the time when, nor the manner how, nor the in≈øtrument by whom he was called. And this is a very comfortable Conclu≈øion. There are ≈øome that pre≈øs conver≈øion ≈øo high, that if a man cannot tell the time when, or the manner how, or the Sermon by which he was called, they ≈øay that he is not yet converted; this is too rigid a Doctrine; and the Scripture makes more for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this, that a man may have a grounded a≈ø≈øurance of his effectuall calling, when he neither knows the time, nor the manner, nor the in≈øtrument, by which he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.27. <hi>And he ≈øaid, ≈øo is the Kingdome of God, as if a man ≈øhould ca≈øt ≈øeed into the ground, and ≈øhould ≈øleep,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115140:35"/>and ri≈øe night and day, and the ≈øeed ≈øhould ≈øpring up and grow he knows not how.</hi> The ≈øeed here ≈øown, is the work of grace; <hi>for ≈øo is the Kingdom of God,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt: and here this ≈øeed ≈øprings up; the man cannot tell haply the day he ≈øow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, nor how he ≈øcattered it; yet this ≈øeed ≈øprings up he knows not how. So a man may have the ≈øeed of grace ≈øown in his heart, which is effectuall calling, and yet it grows up he knows not how, nor when he was called. So <hi>John</hi> 9. (I only allude to it) 19, 20. It is ≈øpoken there of the man that was healed by Je≈øus Chri≈øt; the blind Sonne, that had his eyes opened by Je≈øus Chri≈øt: What ≈øay his Parents? <hi>We know this is our ≈øon, and that he was born blind; but by what means he now ≈øeeth we know not, nor who opened his eyes.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, So I may ≈øay of a poor ≈øinner; a poor ≈øinner is like this blind ≈øonne, we know we are born blind, neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God nor our ≈øelves. We know, if we are converted, we now ≈øee, but how this was done, or by whom this was done, man cannot ≈øo exactly determine.</p>
               <p>But now, this Conclu≈øion doth not hold true in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, if a man have been a profane liver; then it is impo≈ø≈øible in an ordinarie way, that that man ≈øhould be effectually called, but he mu≈øt know the time when he is called: but for others that from their childhood have been brought up in a godly familie, and from their child-hood to their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, did never break out into any ≈øcandalous ≈øinne; the≈øe men cannot give an account either when, or by whom they were called, and yet their calling may be effectuall: and therfore that is too rigid a Doctrine, to pre≈øs ≈øuch heights Qualifications before conver≈øion; for God hath different wayes and degrees of working, though all are not obvious to our eye.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That they who are called by Chri≈øt, they ≈øhall be kept by Chri≈øt, that they do not fall from their Call, but be brought to the ≈øtate of glory, and that's another comfortable conclu≈øion: you are not called by Chri≈øt, and ≈øo left to your ≈øelves and the wide world, as <hi>Adam</hi> was. <hi>Adam</hi> was called by God to a ≈øtate of ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe, but he was left to ≈øtand by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115140:36"/>his own ≈øtrength, but you are not ≈øo: You are not only called by Chri≈øt, but you are kept by Chri≈øt, that you ≈øhall not fall from grace, being once called to it. <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 1. <hi>Jude the ≈øervant of Chri≈øt, to them that are ≈øanctified by God the Father, pre≈øerved in Chri≈øt and called.</hi> Here then is your comfort, that you are not called by Chri≈øt, and left to your ≈øelves; but you are pre≈øerv'd by Chri≈øt, and called and kept in a ≈øtate of grace, till you ≈øhall come to glory.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Doctrine I am yet upon in the pro≈øecution of the≈øe words, is this, <hi>That Chri≈øtians ≈øhould put forth a great deal of diligence to make this ≈øure to their ≈øouls, that they are effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> In the managing of which, I laid down the la≈øt Lords day twenty Propo≈øitions; ten in relation to wicked men not called, and ten conclu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the comfort of them that are effectually called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt. I am now to proceed in the di≈øpatch of ≈øix ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of con≈øcience, which I ≈øhall handle about effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Three of which concern men not effectually called, and three touching Believers, who are called by Chri≈øt to grace here, and to hopes of glory in the world to come.</p>
               <p>The three fir≈øt ca≈øes touching wicked men are the≈øe:</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Whether a wicked man be able to re≈øi≈øt his own call?</p>
               <p>Secondly, What temptations doth the Devil ≈øugge≈øt, to keep a wicked man from entertaining and embracing the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What delu≈øions doth the Devil u≈øe to deceive Hypocrites, to make them pre≈øumptuou≈øly believe, that they are effectually called, when they are not?</p>
               <p>There are three ca≈øes more touching godly men: As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Whether may a man that is effectually called, be any way a≈ø≈øured that he is ≈øo?</p>
               <p>Secondly, If a man may be a≈ø≈øured, then what is the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115140:37"/>rea≈øon many a godly man is not a≈ø≈øured of his effectual calling?</p>
               <p>And then Thirdly, How may he come to get the a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his effectual calling? I begin with the fir≈øt, about wicked men that are not called; and the ca≈øe is this,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Whether may a wicked man, a man as yet not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, be able to re≈øi≈øt and keep off his own cal?</p>
               <p>And that you may under≈øtand the an≈øwer hereto, I mu≈øt lay down this di≈øtinction; That there is a twofold calling of Chri≈øt:</p>
               <p>A Significative calling, and an operative calling.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, a Significative calling, which is ≈øuch a calling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chri≈øt in the Mini≈øtry of the word, ≈øignifies and declares what he would have men to do: Now this kind of call, wicked men may re≈øi≈øt; this call, I ≈øay, and this revealed will of God, in declaring what graces he would have men act, and what ≈øins he would have men forbear: Therefore we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.5. <hi>You ≈øtiff-necked people, and uncircumci≈øed in heart and eares, you have alwayes re≈øi≈øted the Holy Gho≈øt;</hi> meaning the Preaching of the word, by the Mini≈øtry of his Apo≈øtles. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. <hi>I have called, and ye have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then Secondly, There is an Operative calling, and that is ≈øuch a call, whereby God doth not onely ≈øignifie to a man what he mu≈øt do, but with the ≈øignification of his will, gives a man a power to do what he calls him to do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the word with his Spirit, making the heart ≈øtoop and yeeld to Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Now this cal no man can re≈øi≈øt; Grace is irre≈øi≈øtable; and this effectual calling by the operation of the Spirit, a man cannot re≈øi≈øt. All the gain-≈øayings of the heart, and all the ≈øtoutne≈ø≈øe of the will it mu≈øt ≈øtoop, and mu≈øt be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ≈øubjection to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given me, ≈øaith Chri≈øt, ≈øhall come unto me.</hi> They ≈øhal not be able to with≈øtand Je≈øus Chri≈øt, but they ≈øhal come in unto him. So <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 55.10. <hi>As the rain comes down, and the ≈ønow from Heaven, and returns not thither again, but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115140:37"/>waters the earth, to make it bring forth, ≈øo ≈øhall my word be that goes out of my mouth, it ≈øhall not return in vain; but ≈øhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øh that which I intended, and it ≈øhall pro≈øper in the thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I ≈øent it.</hi> As all the world cannot hinder the rain from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down on the earth, no more can any man in the world, if God hath an intent to convert and call him, hinder the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the word from redounding upon his ≈øoul.</p>
               <p>Now the an≈øwering of this ca≈øe thus briefly, will admit of a double U≈øe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">∆≤≈øe </seg>2</label> Secondly, The an≈øwering of this <hi>Query,</hi>  is for con≈øola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to elect men, who are not yet converted. Do≈øt thou belong to Gods Election? Why, before thou art convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou ha≈øt a ≈øtubborn wil, thou ha≈øt a gain≈øaying heart, thou ha≈øt a ≈øtout ≈øpirit again≈øt God, thy heart is as hard as an Adamant, as hard as the Rocks; yet here is thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, all the gain-≈øayings of thy ≈øpirit, and all the ≈øtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of thy will, it ≈øhall not be able to keep off converting mercy, and ≈øhall not be able to keep off calling grace from thee: When God hath an intent to call thee, he will come with Power by his call, and make thee do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thee, and make thee imbrace what he cals thee to. Did not Je≈øus Chri≈øt u≈øe an operative call, as well as a ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative call, no man in the world would ever be called. And this is the rea≈øon, that in hearing the ≈øame Sermon, and following the ≈øame Preacher, one man is converted, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not. The rea≈øon is this, The call of the Mini≈øtry is onely a ≈øignificative call of a Reprobate; onely ≈øignifying what God would have him do: But there is no power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed with the invitation, to make the man able to do what Chri≈øt cals him to; and therefore one is called, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ca≈øe. </seg>2</label> Secondly,  What temptations doth the Devil ≈øugge≈øt to men, who are uncalled, that they ≈øhould not give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to, or embrace the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt unto grace and glory? And in an≈øwer to this, I ≈øhall lay down onely four ≈øugge≈øtions of the Devil, wherewith he entangles a man, that he ≈øhould not yeeld to the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And as I lay them down, I ≈øhall labour to take them away. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. The fir≈øt temptation the Devil will ≈øugge≈øt, is to you that are young men; and to you he will ≈øugge≈øt, that you are yet too young to imbrace the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, 'twill be time enough hereafter, and you may do it ≈øoon enough hereafter; you are too young now to be abridg'd of your plea≈øure, and to mortifie your lu≈øts, and to betake your ≈øelves unto ≈øo ≈øerious a cour≈øe as Chri≈øt cals you to: and by this temptation, the Devil prevails with young men more e≈øpecially. And I remember <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> ≈øaith, that this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil, made him keep off for ≈øeven years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from embracing the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; the Devil would ≈øtill tell him in his heart, thou art too young to leave thy Drunkenne≈ø≈øe, and too young to leave thy Harlots; till at la≈øt he cryed out, How long ≈øhall I ≈øay, it is too ≈øoon? Why may I not repent to day? This temptation I ≈øay, it hath fa≈øtened upon many before you, that they were too young to come in to Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and to this end, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will ≈øugge≈øt to you that old and fal≈øe Proverb, <hi>A young Saint, and an old Devil:</hi> Whereas indeed, if you are young Devils, you will be old <hi>Beelzebubs.</hi> And therefore this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ≈øugge≈øtion, prevailing with many hearts, I ≈øhall lay down ≈øix con≈øiderations, to take off this temptation, that it may not prevail with you.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, If the Devil tempt you, that you are yet too yong to hearken to Chri≈øts call, con≈øider, That the Devil cannot give you a Lea≈øe of your lives; if the Devil could give you a Lea≈øe of your lives, and tell you, you ≈øhould live till old age, you might then with more ≈øafety hearken to his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but your lives are not at the Devils di≈øpo≈øal, God is the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115140:38"/>Author of your life; the i≈ø≈øues of life, and death are in his hands; you may dye in youth, and if you die in youth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, you may be damned, as well as dead. You may be as the≈øe men, <hi>Job</hi> 36.14. <hi>That ≈øhall dye in their youth, and their lives ≈øhall be among the unclean.</hi> And therefore though the Devil tempt you, that you are too young, ≈øeeing he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not a≈ø≈øure you of your lives, you have no rea≈øon to hearken to his temptation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppo≈øe the Devil could a≈ø≈øure you, you ≈øhould live till old age; yet take this con≈øideration, that in putting off your calling, and the work of conver≈øion from your youth, this may ≈øo provoke God, that he may harden your hearts in your old dayes, that you ≈øhall have no heart to think of, and imbrace the call and invitation of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. <hi>I ≈øpake to thee in thy pro≈øperity, but thou would≈øt not hear, and this hath been thy manner from thy youth; Thou would≈øt not obey my voyce.</hi> God ≈øpake, but they would not hear, and it was from their youth that they did thus; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would never ≈øpeak more: God hardened their hearts, that they ≈øhould never receive or imbrace the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. So <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 6.9.10. Seeing the Jewes from their youth were ob≈øtinate again≈øt the word of God, <hi>Go,</hi> (≈øaith God) <hi>make their ears heavy, and their hearts fat, and their eyes blind, that they ≈øhould not be called, and converted, and I ≈øhould ≈øave them.</hi> Let this therefore be a ≈øecond con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the putting off your call till your old age, may ≈øo provoke God, as never to give you hearts to imbrace his call.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Suppo≈øe all this, that you could have a Lea≈øe of your lives, and you could be a≈ø≈øured, that when you come to old age, your hearts ≈øhould not be hardened; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider this, that the more ≈øinful and evil the dayes of your youth have been, the more di≈øquietne≈øs of mind, and horror of con≈øcience will this breed in you when you are old, though you ≈øhould be called, and converted by Je≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>Job.</hi> 13.24, 25, 26. <hi>Thou hide≈øt thy face, thou holde≈øt me as thy Enemy. Thou do≈øt drive me as a leaf to and fro, and thou do≈øt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115140:39"/>pur≈øue me like dry ≈øtubble.</hi> Now why doth <hi>Job</hi> complain thus? Mark the next words, <hi>For thou write≈øt bitter things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt me, and make≈øt me to po≈ø≈øe≈øs the iniquities of my youth. Job,</hi> when he was a young man, it ≈øeems he was a wicked man, and had many ≈øins in his youth, and this in his old age made him cry out, and ≈øay, that God took him for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that God brake him like a leaf driven with the wind. O beloved, the ≈øins of your youth, though you ≈øhould be <hi>Jobs,</hi> converted, yet they wil bring great di≈øquietne≈øs, and great horror, when you come to age; the lu≈øts of youth, and the vanities of youth, and the ≈øen≈øual plea≈øures of your youthful dayes, they will lay a foundation of ≈øorrow, when you come to gray hairs, to be neare your graves; ≈øo <hi>Job</hi> 20.11. And therefore, put the ca≈øe you ≈øhould repent, and ≈øhould be called when you are old, you have no cau≈øe to put off the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, ≈øeeing ≈øins of youth will fill you with horror and di≈øquietne≈øs of mind. Hence it is, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> after he was call'd by the power of the word, cryes out, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 25. <hi>Lord, remember not the ≈øins of my youth;</hi> that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled and gall'd his con≈øcience, the ≈øins of his youth before his call.
<note place="margin">Quae fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt inaenia juventut is gaudia, haec ≈øunt acerba ≈øenectutis gravamina.</note> It is the ≈øpeech of an Author, that to look on the plea≈øurable vanities and contents of youth, this will become an heavy burden, and bitter vexation in old age. Beloved, the more evil you run out into in your youthful daies, the greater and deeper foundation of di≈øquietne≈ø≈øe and ≈øorrow you lay in your ≈øouls in your latter daies; though you ≈øhould be called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Devil ≈øugge≈øt, that you are too young to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the invitation of Chri≈øt: con≈øider, That Je≈øus Chri≈øt will take it mo≈øt kindly at your hands, if while you are young you will give intertainment to his call, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I remember thee,</hi> ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>and the kindne≈øs of thy youth, that thou would≈øt follow me in the Wilderne≈øs, in a Land that was not ≈øown.</hi> Mark how the Lord ≈øpeaks, and how kindly he takes it, that they would in their youth follow God; the Lord will remember it, and take it acceptably from you, if while you are young, while the Marrow is in your bones, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115140:39"/>≈øtrength in your joynts, you will imbrace the wayes of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. It is an ob≈øervation that ≈øome have, concerning the beloved Di≈øciple <hi>John,</hi> John 20. <hi>He is called the Di≈øciple whom Chri≈øt loved, and that leaned upon his bre≈øt;</hi> of all the other eleven Di≈øciples, Chri≈øt did love <hi>John</hi> above the re≈øt; and Divines give this rea≈øon of it, <hi>John</hi> was the younge≈øt of all the Di≈øciples, he was converted and called by Chri≈øt, when he was a young man; and Chri≈øt ≈øeeing a young man follow him, took this very kindly at his hands, and cals him his beloved Di≈øciple. As you that are Parents, you let your little Children ≈øit in your lap, when your great ones ≈øhall not; ≈øo <hi>John,</hi> he being a young man, Chri≈øt would let him lean upon his bre≈øt, and lie in his bo≈øome, expre≈ø≈øing his kindne≈ø≈øe to him.</p>
               <p>Now, O how ≈øhould this beat off this temptation that you are too young to follow Chri≈øt, becau≈øe Chri≈øt takes it ≈øo kindly at your hands, if you imbrace his call in time: nay, Chri≈øt doth take it ≈øo kindly, that he doth love bare Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Civility in young men; and therefore it is ≈øaid in <hi>Matthew,</hi> when Chri≈øt ≈øaw the young man, and he told him,
<note place="margin">Matt. 19.20</note> 
                  <hi>I have ob≈øerved the≈øe things from my youth, Chri≈øt look'd upon him, and loved him:</hi> Chri≈øt ≈øhewed a general love to the young man, that was but a Moral man from his youth; and if Chri≈øt love Morality, he will much more love Piety, and true Sincerity. It is ob≈øerved of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that of one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, <hi>Paul</hi> expre≈ø≈øed more love to <hi>Timothy,</hi> then any other: Read over all the book of God, you ≈øhall never find <hi>Paul</hi> expre≈ø≈øe ≈øo much love to any, as to <hi>Timothy;</hi> he cals him <hi>Timothy my ≈øon,</hi> Timothy, <hi>who ≈øerveth me as a child,</hi> and <hi>Timothy my dearly beloved;</hi> and why was all this? Why the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe <hi>Timothy</hi> from a child was converted, <hi>and knew the Scriptures.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. He was from a child converted and called by the Mini≈øtery of the word in <hi>Paul's</hi> mouth; and this did more indear the heart of <hi>Paul</hi> unto him. You read in the book of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> that when God did require a Sacrifice, he would not have an old Sheep, but a young Lamb, a Lamb of a year old, and a Kid of the yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115140:40"/>of the Flook: And it was ≈øignificative in this, not only to ≈øhew that Chri≈øt our Sacrifice ≈øhould die and ≈øuffer for our ≈øins in the flower of his age, but al≈øo to ≈øhew that Je≈øus Chri≈øt looks upon that as an abominable Sacrifice, when you will not be of his Fold, while you are as young Lambs; O Beloved, Chri≈øt takes it wonderful kindly, if in your youth you do imbrace his call.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Yield not to the Devils temptation, con≈øidering this, that though you ≈øhould be converted in your old age, yet Chri≈øt cannot but take this very unkindly at your hands, that you ≈øhould put him off until your la≈øt end, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve (if any part, yet) the wor≈øt part for his ≈øervice. You know when Chri≈øt ≈øtood all the night for his Spou≈øe, <hi>till his head was full of dew, and his locks were wet with the drops of the night,</hi> he got him gone becau≈øe ≈øhe came not, and would ≈øtay no longer. O how unkindly (think you) will Chri≈øt take this, when he ≈øhall wait year after year, and yet you not imbrace his call!</p>
               <p>It is ≈øaid in <hi>I≈øaiah, All the day long have I ≈øtretched out my hand to a rebellious people, yet they would not hear;</hi> and Mal. 1. <hi>Offer the Lame and the Blind to thy Governour, will he accept of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chri≈øt mu≈øt needs take this unkindly, that you ≈øhould give the Devil the flower of your age, and give to Chri≈øt but the decrepit and infirm parts of your lives; that the Devil ≈øhould ≈øuck out the Marrow of your youth, and onely give God the dry bones, a pal≈øie head, a dim eye, a weak body, and ≈øo all your ≈øervices mu≈øt needs be weak al≈øo: and think but how unkindly Chri≈øt will take your ≈øervices thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Con≈øider this, that from your Birth-day, to your dying day, you have time little enough to carry on the bu≈øine≈øs of your ≈øalvation, ≈øhould you live never ≈øo long; and therefore you have no cau≈øe to put off the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And thus much be ≈øpoken by way of ≈øatisfaction, to take off the fir≈øt temptation, that you are too young to give entertainment to the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: and this I do
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115140:40"/>for the ≈øake of young men, that they may take heed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in≈ønar'd by this delu≈øion of the Devil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Sug.</hi> 2. Here it may be, the Devil cannot in≈ønare you in this Gin: Old men will ≈øay, this concerns not me, I am not taken with this temptation; therefore now the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil comes upon them with this ≈øugge≈øtion: Saith the Devil to them, You cannot now give entertainment to the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, for you have callings in the world to follow; you have a particular calling, and you mu≈øt provide for Wife, and Children, and Familie, and lay up for future times, again≈øt old age and ≈øickne≈ø≈øe, and therefore you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at lea≈øure now to give entertainment to the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; when I am more at lea≈øure, I may look after my effectual calling: And this al≈øo ≈øticks very clo≈øe to a great many.</p>
               <p>And to take off this ≈øugge≈øtion of the Devil, I ≈øhall lay down ≈øix particulars al≈øo, by way of An≈øwer. As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, God never intended that our outward calling ≈øhould any way hinder us in the work of our conver≈øion. God never intended that our imployments upon earth, ≈øhould ju≈øtle out the nece≈ø≈øary provi≈øion for heaven. But God hath ≈øo given out our callings here in the world, that he hath made and ordained them to be ≈øubordinate to our general and effectual calling, to the great bu≈øine≈øs of Gods glory, and our own ≈øalvation.</p>
               <p>It is ≈øaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> that <hi>he walked with God,
<note place="margin">Gen. 6 14</note> and was perfect in his generation.</hi> And yet <hi>Noah</hi> was imployed by God for ≈øome time, to wit, for 120 years in a Handycraft-calling, to build an Ark; to ≈øhew, that God did never intend, as if <hi>Noah</hi>'s making an Ark, ≈øhould any way hinder his walking with God, or carrying on the work of his ≈øoul. Though you have callings to follow, and Families to provide for; yet God did never intend your outward calling ≈øhould ju≈øtle out your inward and effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Con≈øider, you that make this Plea, whether you do not imbezel away much time from your outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which you do not imploy in the concernments of your
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115140:41"/>≈øouls, but in the works of ≈øin and Satan. There is many a man that can plead he hath no lea≈øure to pray, nor no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure to hear a Sermon, he mu≈øt follow his calling; yet this man can follow a Whore, and follow a Tavern, and the≈øe men can ≈øpend a whole day upon recreation, and yet can ≈øpare no time, find no lea≈øure to hearken to Je≈øus Chri≈øt. This now ≈øhould be a great conviction to you, that pretend you mu≈øt follow your calling, that you can neglect your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to follow your ≈øen≈øual and vain cour≈øes; and yet can ≈øpare no time to make your ≈øouls happy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You that plead your outward calling in the world, to be an excu≈øe why you cannot hearken to your effectual calling by Je≈øus Chri≈øt; con≈øider this, that this plea hath damned many a ≈øoul before you, and will damn you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo, if you look not to it. This hath been an ancient plea, <hi>Luke.</hi> 14.18, 19, 20. When Chri≈øt called a company of men there to come to him, what excu≈øe have they? Saith one, <hi>I have bought a yoke of Oxen, and I mu≈øt prove them. I have bought a Farm,</hi> ≈øaith another, <hi>and I mu≈øt manage that. I have marryed a wife, and therefore cannot come,</hi> ≈øaith a third. All the≈øe were lawful callings, and yet the≈øe callings kept them from heaven, and kept them from Je≈øus Chri≈øt. You read, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. When <hi>Paul</hi> did ≈øtartle <hi>Felix</hi>'s con≈øcience by a powerful Sermon of judgment to come, <hi>Felix's heart trembled;</hi> but mark now, how did <hi>Felix</hi> put off the power of the word? Why, <hi>Now</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>I am not at lea≈øure, but go thy wayes, and in convenient time I will ≈øend for thee</hi> to ≈øpeak of this matter. As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, I am now to go about ≈øome other bu≈øine≈øs, about the affairs of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and cannot have lea≈øure to hear thee now; and ≈øo by ≈øome outward imployment, he ju≈øtled the power of the word from his heart, and had not convenient time to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Con≈øider this, That this plea of yours, (in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your callings an excu≈øe, to neglect your effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) it is the onely way to provoke God to cur≈øe, and bla≈øt all your outward callings to you, and to ingage him to cur≈øe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115140:41"/>all you put your hands unto. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 1.6, 9. Becau≈øe they neglected Gods Wor≈øhip, and Gods Ordinances, <hi>Therefore,</hi> ≈øaith God, <hi>you ≈øhall have much, but it ≈øhall come to nothing; and what you get, you ≈øhall put into a bag with holes:</hi> You ≈øhall lo≈øe all you get, and all you ≈øow, and all you labour for, becau≈øe you would not look after Gods Wor≈øhip. So <hi>Micah</hi> 6.13, 14. <hi>I will make thee ≈øick in ≈ømiting thee, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolate becau≈øe of thy ≈øins. Thou ≈øhalt eat, and not be ≈øatisfied; thou ≈øhalt ≈øow, and not reap; thou ≈øhalt tread Olives, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint thy ≈øelf with oyl; and make ≈øweet wine, but ≈øhalt not drink it. For the ≈øtatutes of</hi> Omri <hi>are kept, and all the manners of the hou≈øe of</hi> Ahab, <hi>and you walk in their coun≈øels.</hi> As much as if the Lord ≈øhould ≈øay, You will not hearken to my Statutes, and to my Coun≈øels, but <hi>Omri</hi>'s ≈øtatutes, and <hi>Ahab</hi>'s coun≈øel you will hearken to, <hi>Therefore</hi> now, <hi>you ≈øhall eat, and not be ≈øatisfied; ≈øow, and not reap;</hi> that is, God will cur≈øe what you have, and what you do, becau≈øe you will not hearken to Gods call and coun≈øel. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.38, to 46. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt carry much ≈øeed into the field, and gather but little; the Locu≈øts ≈øhall con≈øume it;</hi> theres one cur≈øe: <hi>And ≈øhalt plant Vineyards, but ≈øhalt not drink the wine, nor gather the grapes, the worm ≈øhall eat them;</hi> another cur≈øe. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt have Olive-trees throughout all thy coa≈øts, but ≈øhalt not anoint thy ≈øelf with Oyl, for thy Olives ≈øhall fall;</hi> theres a third cur≈øe. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt beget ≈øons and daughters, but ≈øhalt not enjoy them; all the trees, and fruit of the land ≈øhall be con≈øumed.</hi> Now what's the rea≈øon of all this? that God ≈øhould thus bla≈øt their callings, and their comforts to them? ver≈øe 45. <hi>Yea, all the≈øe cur≈øes ≈øhall come upon thee, and pur≈øue thee, and overtake thee, becau≈øe thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened≈øt no to the voyce of thy God, to keep his commandments, and his ≈øtatutes, which he commanded thee.</hi> Here is the rea≈øon, they would not hearken to God, nor obey God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would bla≈øt their comforts to them. Now then, Beloved, think of this, you that make your callings a plea, why you cannot hearken to the call of Chri≈øt; this plea is a great provocation to engage God to bla≈øt, and to cur≈øe your very callings to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:115140:42"/>Fifthly, Take this con≈øideration, that God will the more ble≈øs you in your callings, and pro≈øper you in the work of your hands, the more con≈øciencious you are in hearkning to the call and invitation of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe <hi>Godline≈øs hath not onely a promi≈øe of the life to come, but of this life al≈øo.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. And <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>Bring ye all the tythes into the Store-hou≈øe, that there may be meat in my hou≈øe;</hi> that is, ≈øaith God, U≈øe all means, and take all care, that there may be meat in my hou≈øe, that Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be on foot, that my wor≈øhip may be maintained; and what then? And if you will take care of his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, God bids you <hi>prove him, and try him, if he will not take care of you.</hi> ver. 11. Mark the words, <hi>Let there be meat in my hou≈øe, and prove me now, ≈øaith the Lord; if I will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the windows of heaven, and poure forth a ble≈ø≈øing upon you, and there ≈øhall not be room enough to receive it.</hi> A ≈øtrange ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing; that if men will take care to have meat in Gods hou≈øe, and have a care of Gods ordinances; God would open the very windows of heaven, and make the earth ≈øo fruitful, they ≈øhould not have room to receive Gods ble≈ø≈øings. <hi>And I will rebuke the devourer for your ≈øakes, and all nations ≈øhall call you ble≈ø≈øed, and call you a delight≈øome land.</hi> Here now you ≈øee if you will take care of Gods ordinances, and imbrace his call, God will ble≈øs your outward calling the more; and give you in a more abundant increa≈øe, if you imbrace the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You that urge your outward callings as a rea≈øon why you cannot hearken to the call of Chri≈øt; take this for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, that if truth were known, it is not the urgencie of your callings, but the ob≈øtinacie of your wils, and the ≈ølug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øhne≈ø≈øe of your ≈øpirits is the cau≈øe, you do not give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the cal of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. If it were mens callings urged them, they would not take plea≈øure in ≈øin; therefore, it is not their callings, but the badne≈ø≈øe of their hearts; they do not love Chri≈øt, and love his waies, but think it too indu≈øtrious a work to labour for conver≈øion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make this plea. <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115140:42"/>me that ye might have life:</hi> When will is wanting, ≈øaith D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pre≈øton,</hi> any vain excu≈øe wil be pretended. When wil is wanting to walk in the waies of God, any groundle≈øs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence wil be made to excu≈øe their negligence. And thus much to take off the ≈øecond ≈øugge≈øtion, that men have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to follow in the world, and therefore they have no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure to look after their effectuall calling by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sug.</hi> Thirdly, The Divel ≈øugge≈øts, if you give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, this will expo≈øe you to a great deal of povertie, and per≈øecution in this world; and therefore you mu≈øt not hearken to his call: And he will urge Scripture for this. Fir≈øt, For povertie, the Divel wil urge <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.19.20. Chri≈øt ≈øaid, <hi>the Foxes have holes, the Birds of the air have ne≈øts; but the Son of man hath no where to lay his head:</hi> The Divel wil urge this Scripture, and tell you, you are expo≈øed to povertie, want, and beggerie, if you follow Chri≈øt. And this we read in hi≈øtorie likewi≈øe of <hi>Lucius,</hi> the fir≈øt Chri≈øtian King that ever <hi>England</hi> had; (and indeed the fir≈øt Chri≈øtian King that ever any Nation had, to the glory of <hi>England;</hi> ≈øo <hi>Gildas</hi> in his life tels us). And this King, though he was turned to Chri≈øtianitie; yet for many years he had this temptation upon him, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians were poorer then the <hi>Romans,</hi> that did not imbrace Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and this temptation he could hardly ≈øhake off: the <hi>Romans</hi> were more wealthie, and the <hi>Romans</hi> were more warlick, and ≈øo had like to have been overcome with this ≈øugge≈øtion. <hi>Agolantus</hi> a heathen Prince, being taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner by the Emperour and being in his Court, he ≈øaw thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or forty poor men in poor clothes walking in the palace; and demanding of the Emper or who tho≈øe poor men were, the Emperour told him they are the followers of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; are they ≈øo, ≈øaith he? If Chri≈øt keep his followers in ≈øuch a low condition, I will never follow Je≈øus Chri≈øt. The poorne≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øts followers, made him ≈øtumble at Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtianitie. There are many men, e≈øpecially the gallants of the times, they ≈øee a companie of poor ≈øilly women come with a Bible under their armes; and they imbrace the faith, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115140:43"/>they love it; and this is a marvellous great offence to them, that they will not follow Je≈øus Chri≈øt, becau≈øe of the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they are expo≈øed to in the waies of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: And then for per≈øecution al≈øo, that they are not only expo≈øed to want, but to lo≈ø≈øe of libertie, and good name, and life al≈øo; <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.38. You mu≈øt take up the cro≈øs: the≈øe are tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous termes to fle≈øh and blood, and this doth wonderfully gravel and keep back men from entertaining of Chri≈øt. Now to take off this temptation of the Divel, that it might not ≈øeize upon your hearts, I ≈øhal lay down ≈øix particulars by way of an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, That the ≈øervants of God of old time, they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chu≈øe povertie and per≈øecution with the people of God, then to enjoy the vanities and profits of this world with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. And this was <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>'s choice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes when he came to years, refu≈øed to be called the ≈øon of</hi> Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs <hi>Daughter; chu≈øing rather to ≈øuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the plea≈øure of ≈øinne for a ≈øea≈øon; e≈øteeming the reproach of Chri≈øt better then all the riches of Aegypt. Mo≈øes, when he came to yeers;</hi> it was no childi≈øh act, but an act of deliberation; and it was no con≈øtrained act, but <hi>Mo≈øes cho≈øe: rather,</hi> it was an act of his own choice, rather to have affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the plea≈øure of ≈øin for a ≈øea≈øon. It was ≈øpoken of Mr. <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot</hi> his being in the Cole-hou≈øe at <hi>Wind≈øor,</hi> a di≈ømal and dark place. Saith one, I had rather be with <hi>Philpot</hi> in the Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hou≈øe, then be with <hi>Bonner</hi> in his Palace. And being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, why? the one being ≈øo di≈ømal, the other ≈øo beautiful? ≈øaith he, the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe <hi>Bonners</hi> con≈øcience makes his Palace a Cole-hou≈øe; but <hi>Philpots</hi> God, and <hi>Philpots</hi> Chri≈øt makes his Cole-hou≈øe a Palace. And Beloved, this is a truth, though a man ≈øhould be a beggar, if he be <hi>rich in faith,</hi> he is the happie≈øt man in the world. Though a man ≈øhould beg his bread from door to door, if he can beg Chri≈øt and have it, and beg grace and have it; he is the riche≈øt man upon earth. This therfore is my fir≈øt an≈øwer, that the ≈øervants of God, had rather chu≈øe afflictions with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115140:43"/>of God, then have plea≈øures with wicked men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppo≈øe you meet with povertie and per≈øecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in following Chri≈øt, yet con≈øider, Je≈øus Chri≈øt doth make you abundant recompence with that inward peace, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy he fils your hearts withall, for all the outward troubles you meet with in the world. <hi>John</hi> 16.33. <hi>In the world you ≈øhall have tribulation;</hi> but mark the Cordial, <hi>In me ye ≈øhall have peace,</hi> therefore <hi>be of good chear, I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world.</hi> Though you have troubles in the world, yet you have joy in me, and peace in me; and therefore why ≈øhould you be offended?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Con≈øider, Though you want many things in the world, yet you ≈øhall want nothing that is good for you; <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>He wil give grace and glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that live a godly life.</hi> If riches be good for thee, thou ≈øhalt not want it; if wealth be good for you, you ≈øhal not want it; if e≈øtate be good for you, you ≈øhall not want that; for he wil with-hold nothing from them that live a godly life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A gracious heart, if he hath or can find that he hath a real intere≈øt in Chri≈øt, though he wants much in the world,
<note place="margin">Habent om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, qui ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem omnia.</note> he thinks he wants nothing; but he hath all things in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Chri≈øt; nor will he complain of povertie, when endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the riches of heaven. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25. <hi>And Chri≈øt ≈øaid unto them, when I ≈øent you without pur≈øe, and without ≈øcrip, and ≈øhoos, lacked you any thing?</hi> Mark the que≈øtion. Now, if a carnal man had been to an≈øwer this, what would he have ≈øaid? What? ≈øend a man without a pur≈øe, then he wants mony; ≈øend him without a ≈øcrip, he wants meat; ≈øend him without ≈øhoos, a man is a poor man indeed, that hath no ≈øhoos to his feet; a carnal man would have ≈øaid, Yes Lord, we want mony, and we want meat, and we want ≈øhoos; but ask the Di≈øciples, <hi>wanted you any thing? They ≈øaid, Nothing.</hi> And why was this? Becau≈øe the Di≈øciples knew they had a grounded intere≈øt in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and a right to Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, and though they wanted the≈øe poor outward comforts, they did not want Chri≈øts comfort, and Chri≈øts graces; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115140:44"/>when they had neither pur≈øe, ≈øcrip, nor ≈øhoos, they wanted nothing. Why, O Beloved, if you were of the temper of the≈øe gracious Di≈øciples, you would ≈øay ≈øo too; that if you can find a grounded and real intere≈øt in Chri≈øt, though you want many of the Comforts of this world, you will ≈øay you want nothing. <hi>Wanted yee any thing? and they ≈øaid, Nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. You that make povertie and per≈øecution a plea, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider this, that the poor are ordinarily the mo≈øt people that Je≈øus Chri≈øt doth cal to imbrace his Go≈øpel. <hi>The poor receive the Go≈øpel,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>and ble≈ø≈øed are you that are not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at it; Not many wi≈øe, not many noble are called, but the poor things of the world hath God cho≈øen.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26. And in <hi>James, God hath cho≈øe the poor of this world, to be rich in faith.</hi> Do not therefore Beloved make this a plea to keep off from Chri≈øt, becau≈øe ordinarily they are the people Chri≈øt pitcheth mo≈øt love upon, and doth delight to make them rich in grace, who are poor in goods.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Con≈øider, That if upon this ground you refu≈øe the call of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, you are expo≈øed to more Povertie, and to wor≈øe per≈øecution then ever you could be expo≈øed to, in the entertaining of Chri≈øt. In the following of Chri≈øt, you are only expo≈øed to an outward povertie; but in neglecting the cal of Chri≈øt, you are expo≈øed to be poor in faith, and to be ≈øuch a beggar, as not to be endowed with one dram of grace; and then you are beggars indeed. As we ≈øay, he is a poor man that God hates; he that hath not Chri≈øt, and hath not the trea≈øures of heaven in him; he is expo≈øed to wor≈øe povertie a thou≈øand times then he can be for embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cal of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. Yea, and he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to wor≈øe per≈øecution al≈øo, that for fear of per≈øecution, neglects Ie≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 83.5. <hi>The Lord will per≈øecute them, ≈øaith</hi> David, <hi>with furie and wrath;</hi> ≈øpeaking of wicked men. All per≈øecution from man reaches but to the body, but this from God reacheth to the ≈øoul.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And then la≈øtly, This ≈øhould not hinder you from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Ie≈øus Chri≈øt; con≈øidering, that though you ≈øhould
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115140:44"/>be poor and ≈øhould be per≈øecuted, yet heaven wil make you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for al, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. Heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> wil make amends for poverty, when you are indowed with all the riches of Chri≈øt, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven wil make amends for per≈øecution; when there the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øhal be at re≈øt, and there the troubled ≈øhal be at ea≈øe. And thus much be ≈øpoken of the third ≈øugge≈øtion of the Devil, that if you entertain the cal of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, you ≈øhal be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to much poverty, and per≈øecution here in the world.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Doctrine I am yet upon, is this. <hi>That Chri≈øtians ought to put forth a great deal of diligence, to make this ≈øure to their ≈øouls, that they are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> In the pro≈øecution of which, I have re≈øolved one ca≈øe of con≈øcience, and am yet upon the ≈øecond ca≈øe; namely, what ≈øugge≈øtions the Devil doth u≈øe to keep men off from imbracing the call of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: I have laid down and an≈øwered three already.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now there is one ≈øugge≈øtion more; when the Devil ≈øees neither of the≈øe wil take place, then he comes in with a fourth, to di≈ø≈øwade men from imbracing the call of Chri≈øt; and that is this, Why, ≈øaith the Devil, if you will entertain the call of Chri≈øt, you will abridge your ≈øelves of all the joy and comfort of your lives; you will never have merry daies while you live upon earth. You ≈øee men, that pretend to be converted, and do hear Sermons, what lumpi≈øh and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy men they are, not ≈øo jocund and jolly as others are, that walk not ≈øo preci≈øely; if you follow Chri≈øt, and his Go≈øpel, this wil ca≈øheer all your merry daies, and this wil put you into a ≈øad temper; all your jovial daies are gone. Therefore to take off this a≈øper≈øion, that the wais of Chri≈øt are ≈øad and melancholy waies; which hath been an a≈øper≈øion that from age to age, &amp; generation to generation, hath been
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115140:45"/>as a Gin the Devil hath u≈øed to keep men from Chri≈øtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts, to deter men from Chri≈øtianity, and the Prote≈øtant Religion, they would hold their Di≈øciples in hand with this, that the ≈øpirit of a <hi>Calvini≈øt,</hi> is a ≈øad and lumpi≈øh ≈øpirit; and therefore they would di≈ø≈øwade all Nations from turning to their Religion; and this the Prie≈øts were to tel in all the Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi> how ≈øad and melancholy they were, that turned to the <hi>Calvini≈øts</hi> Religion; and this did mightily ≈øtay the people from imbracing the truth. And this a≈øper≈øion hath pa≈ø≈øed from hand to hand, and is many times prevalent upon the ≈øpirits of men that are of the true Religion, that they mu≈øt not be too forward in the practice of Religion, fearing le≈øt this ≈øhould work melancholy and ≈øad thoughts in them.</p>
               <p>Now to take off this, I ≈øhal onely urge four or five heads briefly.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Whereas you ≈øay, they are melancholy and ≈øad, that are called by Chri≈øt to a profe≈ø≈øion of his waies; I would an≈øwer thus, That they of all people in the world, have mo≈øt cau≈øe of mirth and gladnes, and they are the mo≈øt truly joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people in the world. That they have mo≈øt cau≈øe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing is apparent: When the Di≈øciples came triumphing that they could ca≈øt out Devils, heal the di≈øea≈øed, and work Miracles: O, but ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>Rejoyce not in this, but rejoyce that your names are written in the book of Life, Luke</hi> 10.20. As much as if Chri≈øt ≈øhould ≈øay, All the indowments and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, they are no ≈øuch grounds of joy, if you had them all; but here is your joy, and cau≈øe of rejoycing, that your names are written in the book of Life; that you are in Chri≈øt, and your ≈øouls ≈øhal be ≈øaved. And ≈øo <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwaies, again I ≈øay, rejoyce.</hi> The Apo≈øtle would not ≈øpeak it to them with a ≈øingle command, but doubles his expre≈ø≈øion, to ≈øhew, that they that are people that have their ≈øins pardoned, that have their ≈øouls reconciled, that have a Title to glory,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115140:46"/>who≈øe names are written in the book of Life; the≈øe of all men in the world, have mo≈øt cau≈øe of joy and gladne≈øs. And they have not onely mo≈øt cau≈øe, but they do mo≈øt truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and have more real joy in their hearts in one day, then the wicked can have all their lives, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>They rejoyce with joy un≈øpeakable and full of glory.</hi> What joy you have in the world, the tongue is able to ≈øpeak of it, but the tongue is not able to ≈øpeak of that inward joy that godly men have in their hearts, upon the apprehen≈øion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt they have in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance.</hi> And <hi>Thou ≈øhalt put more gladne≈øs in mine heart, &amp;c.</hi> Prov. 14.13. <hi>A good con≈øcience is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fea≈øt.</hi> Men are never more merrie, then when they are at a fea≈øt; godly men, they carry clear con≈øciences about them, and that makes them as ioyous and plea≈øant, as if they were alwaies at a great and ≈øumptuous fea≈øt. Indeed this is true, they do not rejoyce with ≈øuch exorbitancies of joy as wicked men do. Wicked men rejoyce in ≈øin, that they cannot do; wicked men rejoyce in their lu≈øts, in their drunkenne≈øs, and their adulteries, and waies of ≈øin, that godly men dare not do. Such a rejoycing as this, is the foundation of ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: This rejoycing (like the Prodigal) in a riotous cour≈øe of living, is the foundation of ≈øorrow, and wil meet with you, when you are to die.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Grant this ≈øhould be true; yet con≈øider, that this ≈øorrow that godly people have, it is ≈øuch a ≈øorrow, that they ≈øhal have no cau≈øe to repent thereof, but it is a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of future joy to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>I rejoyce</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>in that I have made you ≈øorrowful.</hi> What, rejoyce to ≈øee them a ≈øad people? Yes, for the ≈øorrow I made you ≈øorrowful with, was <hi>a ≈øorrow never to be repented of,</hi> you wil never repent of that ≈øorrow; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> would do it,
<note place="margin">P≈øal. 126.</note> becau≈øe it was a ≈øorrow, never to be ≈øorrowed for; nay, it is not only ≈øuch a ≈øorrow as is not to be repented of, but it is a ≈øorrow that laies a foundation to a great deal of future joy, <hi>They that ≈øow in tears, ≈øhall reap in joy.</hi> But now all the joy of wicked men is a joy, to be repented of. They
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115140:46"/>mu≈øt repent of all their jovial bouts, and repent of all their merrie pa≈øtimes, this wil be ≈øadne≈øs to their remembrance; wheras the ≈øorrow of the godly is ne'er to be ≈øorrow'd for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is true, it may be they are ≈øorrowful, but they are ≈øorrowful for ≈øin, which you have cau≈øe to be that are uncalled, as wel as they, and more: Now if a godly man be ≈øorrowful for ≈øin, this wil never prejudice him. Indeed, <hi>Worldly ≈øorrow brings forth death,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>but godly ≈øorrow brings forth ≈øalvation never to be repented of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It may be they are ≈øorrowful, but how is it? They are not ≈øorrowful becau≈øe they are good, but they are ≈øorrowful becau≈øe they are ≈øo bad. It is not profe≈ø≈øion makes them ≈øorrowful, but it is becau≈øe they can profe≈øs Chri≈øt no better, and profe≈øs him no more zealou≈øly, this is their ≈øorrow; and this ≈øorrow ≈øhould be in all of us, that we can ≈øerve God no better, and bring God no more glory.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They are ≈øorrowful, but it is not for them≈øelves, but for thee; they are not ≈øorry becau≈øe they are good, but becau≈øe thou art ≈øo bad; they are ≈øorry becau≈øe of thy ≈øins, becau≈øe they ≈øee thee an uncalled man ≈øtil, and they ≈øee thee drunk, and ≈øee thee profane, and ≈øee thee di≈øhonour God, and damn thy ≈øoul; and this makes them more ≈øad then they would be. <hi>Lot, his righteous ≈øoul was vext within him, for the wickedne≈ø≈øe of the Sodomites;</hi> 2 Pet. 2.8. And Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, <hi>his eyes run down with tears, for the iniquity of the people</hi> he lived among≈øt. And ≈øo <hi>Paul, I told you before, and now tell you weeping;</hi> there are wicked livers among you, that walk not according to the truth. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Paul</hi> did not weep, becau≈øe he was mi≈øerable; but becau≈øe he ≈øaw ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wicked, and abominable in their lives. So <hi>David, P≈øal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>Mine eyes run down with water, becau≈øe men keep not thy Law.</hi> Ezek. 9.4.</p>
               <p>And la≈øtly, Though you ≈øee ≈øome men ≈øad and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet think not ill of the waies of God; becau≈øe, this way of all other, doth mo≈øt invite to joy and gladne≈øs in the Lord. <hi>Rejoyce evermore, and again I ≈øay, rejoyce, Phil.</hi> 4.4. And <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>The≈øe things I ≈øpeak,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>that your joy might be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115140:47"/>full.</hi> In the profe≈ø≈øion and following of Chri≈øt, it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of Chri≈øt to give you more joy, then ever you had before; there is no ≈øuch cau≈øe therefore to entertain a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice by the Divels temptation again≈øt the waies of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, when he cals you to profe≈ø≈øe his Go≈øpel. And thus much be ≈øpoken to the ≈øecond ca≈øe of con≈øcience in reference to wicked men.</p>
               <p>There is a third ca≈øe touching men uncalled, and that is, What delu≈øions doth the Divell deceive hypocrites by, to make them nouri≈øh pre≈øumptuous per≈øwa≈øions that they are effectually called when they are not? And I intreat you, give me your attentions a little in the di≈øpatch of this mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial que≈øtion. I ≈øhall only lay down four Delu≈øions, whereby the Divel deceives many.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Delu≈ø. </seg>
                  </label> 1. The Divel may delude men by this, becau≈øe they do delight to hear the word preacht, therefore the Divel would egg on this per≈øwa≈øion, ≈øurely your delighting to hear the word, and your following of Sermons, this mu≈øt needs be an evidence of your effectual calling. And here the Divel would mi≈øapply Scripture, as <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that heareth not my words,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>is not of God; he that is of God, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my words.</hi> Now, here th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> Divel would mi≈øapply this Scripture, and tel you, you that hear Gods word, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to hear Sermons, this can be no other then an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidence of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Now, I be≈øeech you to follow me in the taking off this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øion, and ≈øhewing you wherein, and in what ca≈øes, this wil prove but a broken reed unto you. And I ≈øhall ≈øhew you that in five ca≈øes, hearing the word of God with delight, is no evidence of effectual calling, but may be a meer delu≈øion of Satan. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. If your hearing the word, be but a bare hearing, and not a hearing with practice; if you have not practice joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with what you hear, and know, your thus hearing the word with delight, is no evidence of your effectual calling. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>They come before thee as my people cometh, thou art unto them as a very lovely ≈øong of one that hath a plea≈øant voyce,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115140:47"/>as one that can play well upon an in≈øtrument of mu≈øick.</hi> Here the Lord ≈øets forth with what delight they heard <hi>Ezekiel</hi> preach; they heard him as a man that had a very lovely voice, and they heard him as a man that plaied upon an In≈øtrument of Mu≈øick; much delight they took in hearing. Yet, ≈øaith God, <hi>they hear thy words, but do them not.</hi> Beloved, though you take as much delight in hearing a Sermon, as to hear the mo≈øt melodious mu≈øick a cunning hand can make; yet if you bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear with delight, not joyning practice with your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; this is no evidence of effectual calling. Hence it is <hi>James</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. <hi>Be not hearers of the word only, but doers al≈øo, le≈øt you deceive your own ≈øouls.</hi> Implying, that you wil deceive your ≈øouls about effectual calling, if you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear, and do not do. This was the fault of the ≈øtonie ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If your hearing be a partial hearing: I mean thus; if you hear, and wil hear but part of the word, or leave but ≈øome part of your ≈øins by hearing, wil pick and chu≈øe both whom you wil hear, and what you wil hear; in that ca≈øe, your hearing with delight can be no evidence of your effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling. If it be a partial hearing, as fir≈øt, that you wil hear ≈øome part, and wil not hear the other; to hear the promi≈øing part, and not the commanding part; to hear with delight the commanding part, and not hear the threatning part of the word: in this ca≈øe, thus hearing, wil be no evidence of your cal. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>Herod,</hi> it is ≈øaid of him, <hi>he heard John Bapti≈øt gladly, and did many things:</hi> There was his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial hearing: he heard him with joy in many things, but he would not do all. Now, if you aske, wherein was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> failing? <hi>Herod</hi> heard the word with gladne≈øs; yet this was no evidence of his effectual calling. Wherein did he fail, Why mark, compare this Scripture with <hi>Luke</hi> 3.18.19, 20 <hi>Herod,</hi> it is true, he heard <hi>John Bapti≈øt</hi> gladly, while he preached of ordinarie matter; but when <hi>John</hi> came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him of his ≈øins, and told him he was an Adulterer, then he could not endure to hear <hi>John</hi> preach, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in his exhortation did John preach to the people, but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115140:48"/>Herod the Tetrarch being reproved by John, for Herodias his brother</hi> Philips <hi>wife, and for all the evils</hi> Herod <hi>had done, he added yet this above all, to ≈øhut up</hi> John <hi>in pri≈øon.</hi> He would hear <hi>John</hi> no more then: Mark how the Scripture points out a wicked man; <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John</hi> gladly, when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of comfortable and general matter; but when <hi>John</hi> came to reproving matter, and convincing matter, then he would hear him no more; but added this ≈øinne to the re≈øt, to ≈øhut up <hi>John</hi> in pri≈øon. So that to be a partial hearer, gladly to hear ≈øome part of the word, but not all, can be no evidence of effectual calling. So tho≈øe in <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> di≈øcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this temper, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 30.10. <hi>Prophe≈øie to us ≈ømooth things, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie deceits.</hi> There were manymen could delight to hear ≈ømooth and comfortable preaching, but they could not endure to hear a true denunciation of Gods judgments again≈øt them for their ≈øinnes. They love to hear ≈øome part of Gods wil, not all; the promi≈øing part, not the reproving part; this is no evidence of effectual calling. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.17, 18. There were ≈øome lying Prophete≈ø≈øes that did preach, but what did they do? <hi>They ≈øowed pillows under mens elbows;</hi> and the Lord charges them for it, <hi>that they did hunt after their ≈øouls.</hi> To preach ≈ømooth Doctrines, and plau≈øible comfortable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, is but to ≈øow pillows, and hunt after mens ≈øouls. Now, many men love to be ≈ømoothed up, and flattered in their ≈øins; whereas to be a partial hearer, is no ≈øign of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hearing the word with delight, is no evidence of your effectual calling, in ca≈øe this be a fickle, and uncon≈øtant hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. To delight to hear the word, becau≈øe the word comes in reque≈øt, becau≈øe there is no danger in hearing; this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men may delight to do, when yet if times of per≈øecution ≈øhould ari≈øe, they would be fickle, and leave off their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. It is ≈øaid of the ≈øtonie ground, that <hi>the ≈øeed that fell among stones, are they that receive the word with joy;</hi> (there is their delight to hear) <hi>but not having deep root, in times of per≈øecution fell away.</hi> Here the Scripture A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomizeth a man, that he may hear the word with joy ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115140:48"/>when the current of the times run for Religion, when the word comes in fa≈øhion among a people, but if per≈øecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øhould attend the word, and a pri≈øon attend hearing, you would then ≈øee how flag their delights would be in hearing the word: and in this ca≈øe, you may delight to hear the word, yet be no evidence of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In ca≈øe your hearing be a ≈øelfi≈øh hearing: As now, many men may hear the word with delight; why? Becau≈øe, they may get profit by hearing, and prai≈øe and vain glory by hearing the word; and this may make them wonderfully delight to hear. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.1. <hi>There was an innumerable companie went to hear Je≈øus Chri≈øt, in ≈øo much the croud was ≈øo great, that one trod upon another to hear him;</hi> yet Chri≈øt ≈øaith of them, <hi>John</hi> 6.26. <hi>They come to hear me preach, but not for the word I teach, or the miracles I do; but for the loaves they eat of.</hi> It was not love to Chri≈øts per≈øon, or his mini≈øtrie, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they ≈øaw Chri≈øt with a few fi≈øhes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>o feed ≈øo many men, they ≈øeeing of this miracle, this made them frequent the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrie and word of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Many men may hear the word, when ≈øelfi≈øh advantage accompanies hearing, to get more trading, to be better thought of among their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; this is a ≈øelfi≈øh hearing, and in this ca≈øe you may hear, yet not be effectually called. There is a phra≈øe in <hi>Ho≈øea</hi> 7.14. <hi>They cried unto me, and they howled upon their beds, and they a≈ø≈øembled them≈øelves for corn and wine.</hi> Here was a people, that a≈ø≈øembled together at the ordinances of God; but what was their end? there was a dearth and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine likely to come; and here they would u≈øe duties to be a means to prevent a famine, and get corn and wine together. Here was a ≈øelfi≈øh end, and thus men may hear, yet have no evidence of their effectual call.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If your hearing be a divided hearing, and your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light a divided delight, this can be no Argument of your call. As thus, A man may delight to hear, yet if that man divide and ≈øhare his delights, partly to ≈øin, and partly to the Word, this can be no evidence of his effectual calling. In the place before quoted, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 7. <hi>They a≈ø≈øembled together, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115140:49"/>howled upon their beds, yet they ≈øin again≈øt me, ≈øaith the Lord.</hi> There they divided their delights, they would ≈øerve God in his Wor≈øhip, yet they would ≈øin again≈øt him. So tho≈øe, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 58.3, 6, 7. They took delight in drawing near to God, yet in the day of their fa≈øt, found plea≈øure in ≈øin. Now, to have a divided love, to delight in ≈øin, as wel as in Ordinances, this can be no Argument of effectual calling; and your hearing the Word in the≈øe five ca≈øes, is but a meer delu≈øion. But on the contrary, if your hearing be not a bare hearing, but with your delight in hearing, you joyn practice; If it be not a partial hearing, but the commanding and reproving part as welcome as any other; If it be ≈øuch a hearing as is not ≈øelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh, Such a hearing, in which you aim more at Gods glory then your own advantage; if the≈øe be the qualifications, then your delight in hearing the Word, is an evidence of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Delu≈ø. </seg>
                  </label> Yea, but you will urge farther, Though this be not an Argument of our effectual calling, yet we can go one ≈øtep higher; We do not onely delight to hear the Word, but we love the godly who are effectually called to grace and glory; and if we love them, we hope it is an Argument that we al≈øo are called: and they urge that Scripture for it, <hi>We know that we are tran≈ølated from death to life, if we love the Brethren.,</hi> 1 Ioh. 3.14.</p>
               <p>Now, to ≈øpeak to this: I an≈øwer, It is clear in Scripture, that every kind of love to the people of God, is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of effectual calling; but there may be a fained, and a counterfeit love, as wel as any other grace. Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle pre≈ø≈øes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Let your love be without di≈ø≈øimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> importing, that men may di≈ø≈øemble their love, as wel as any grace el≈øe. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Let us not love in word and in tongue onely, but in deed and in truth.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Let there be unfained love to the Brethren:</hi> intimating, that there may be a fained and fal≈øe love. So that every kind of love, is no evidence of effectual calling. And this I ≈øhal make out by this demon≈øtration; Becau≈øe there are ≈øeveral acts or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions of love, that men who are not effectually called,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115140:49"/>may ≈øhew to godly men. Now if a man uncalled, may ≈øhew many expre≈ø≈øions and acts of love to a man converted; then meer ≈øhewing love to a godly man, is no Argument of your effectual calling. I ≈øhal reduce what I have to ≈øay, unto ≈øix Heads: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may be frequently in the companie of godlie men, yet not be effectually called; and ≈øo <hi>Demas</hi> was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Go≈øpel; yet he not called, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the world, and fel away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They may ≈øpeak wel of the people of God. And this <hi>John</hi> tels us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Let us not love in word, or in tongue.</hi> This loving in word and tongue, was to ≈øpeak wel of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie man; this a wicked man may do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may write Letters of commendation in the behalf of a godlie man. And ≈øo you read of <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Wife, which the Scripture gives as no evidence of her Conver≈øion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.19. She wrote a Letter to her Husband in the morning before he was to arraign Chri≈øt, and told him, <hi>Have nothing to do with the blood of that ju≈øt man.</hi> Here you ≈øee, ≈øhe wrote in the behalf of a good man, of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And ≈øo we read of <hi>Claudius Ly≈øias,</hi> that he wrote a Letter in the behalf of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Felix</hi> the Governor; here were great acts of love, yet the≈øe no evidence of their effectual calling. Nay,</p>
               <p n="4">4. They may think nothing too much to give to good men, yet not be called. And ≈øo did the <hi>Galathians,</hi> who≈øe calling <hi>Paul</hi> que≈øtions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. <hi>They would pull out their own eyes, and not think them too dear for Paul:</hi> Yet at length how cold did they grow, <hi>and count</hi> Paul <hi>their enemy, for tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them the truth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They may expre≈øs ≈øuch love, that in times of danger they may take care of the ≈øafetie of godlie men, ≈øo <hi>Acts</hi> 23.27. <hi>Claudius Ly≈øias,</hi> when he heard <hi>Paul</hi> was in danger of his life, he came with an Armie of men to re≈øcue him, that they ≈øhould not take away his life from him; and yet <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Ly≈øias</hi> lived and died a Heathen, for ought the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture mentions.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, They may relieve the nece≈ø≈øities of the godlie, yet
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115140:50"/>not be effectually called. Now here are high expre≈ø≈øions of love, yet it is evident, all the≈øe may be, where calling is not.</p>
               <p>But now its true, in ≈øome ca≈øes love to the people of God, may prove a good evidence of ones effectual call; to wit, if it have the≈øe four qualifications.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you love the people of God under this notion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe godlie, it is an evidence of your effectual call; becau≈øe there is good in them, more then becau≈øe you receive good from them. Hence it is, <hi>John</hi> tels us, wicked men may love a godlie man, becau≈øe they have good from him. 2 <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>To the elect Lady, whom I love in the truth, for the truths ≈øake dwelling in her. John</hi> did not love the Ladie, becau≈øe ≈øhe was a Ladie, or becau≈øe ≈øhe was a goodlie wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but <hi>for the truths ≈øake that dwelt in her.</hi> Whereas wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, they love a godlie man, but not as godlie, under that notion. Therefore you ≈øhal ≈øee the difference between <hi>Johns</hi> love to a godlie per≈øon, and <hi>Claudius Ly≈øias</hi> a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.27. <hi>Claudius Ly≈øias</hi> tels you there, <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>was in danger of his life, and with an Army I re≈øcued him.</hi> Now why was it he did ≈øo? did he love <hi>Paul</hi> becau≈øe a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie man? no, for mark the next words; <hi>With an Army I re≈øcued him, becau≈øe it was told me he was a Roman.</hi> He loved <hi>Paul</hi> for his Nation, not for his conver≈øion: had he loved <hi>Paul</hi> as <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> as a Chri≈øtian, this were an Argument of grace; but to love <hi>Paul</hi> as a Roman, becau≈øe of Country and Nation ≈øake, this was no evidence of his call. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.46, 47. <hi>If ye love them that love you, what reward have you? do not even the Publicans ≈øo?</hi> So that you ≈øee a wide difference between the love of a godlie man, and of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To mea≈øure your love to them by their graces, that you love that man mo≈øt, that hath mo≈øt grace, thats an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of effectual calling; becau≈øe it is grace in the man, and nothing el≈øe you love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If your love be univer≈øal to all that are godly, of what ≈øort or condition ≈øoever they be, this is an evidence of your
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115140:50"/>effectual calling; for then 't is evident, that grace, as grace, is the object of your love.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, To love a man ≈øo, as to carry compa≈ø≈øion in your bre≈øts towards him, to have a ≈øympathizing heart with him in his ≈øufferings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Sufferone with another, love as Brethren.</hi> This ≈øhewes your love to be true, when it hath pity and compa≈ø≈øion to attend it.</p>

                  </label> I pa≈øs now to a third delu≈øion, which indeed is a main delufion, and hath deceived many, ≈øpecially tho≈øe that profe≈øs the Go≈øpel, to make them believe they are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called, when they are not. And that is, becau≈øe they di≈øcern a change in their conver≈øation, that they are not the ≈øame men they were in days pa≈øt; and hereby the Divel props up this per≈øwa≈øion, that ≈øurely they mu≈øt needs be effectually called, and he alledges Scripture for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Such were ≈øome of you, but yee are wa≈øhed,</hi> &amp;c. Now this being ≈øo univer≈øall a delu≈øion among mo≈øt men in the world, that if they have hopes of Heaven, it is upon this ground, that they are not the ≈øame now they were in times pa≈øt. I ≈øhall therefore a little inlarge my ≈øelfe in ≈øpeaking of this particular and ≈øhall lay downe ≈øix or ≈øeven particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, wherein I ≈øhall ≈øhew, that this ground taken in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is no infallible evidence of a mans effectuall calling.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe there are many graduall changes, which do not come up, or amount to a ≈øaving change or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart of man. As there is a change from a Pagan to a Chri≈øtian, ≈øo was <hi>Julian</hi> chang'd, yet a man never called by <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> Then there is a change from a per≈øecuter to be a countenancer of Religion, ≈øo we read <hi>Valerius Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iminus</hi> was changed, who was the vile≈øt per≈øecuter of all men in his time, and the hand of God lying ≈øo ≈øore upon him for that ≈øin, that his very bowels rotted within him, and the very worms crept out of them, and in horror of con≈øcience he cryed out to his Nobles about him, per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them by his example, to take heed never to per≈øecute the Chri≈øtians more. Now both the≈øe were great changes, and yet they are but graduall changes, that leave men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115140:51"/>≈øhort of tho≈øe ≈øaving changes that God works in them that are effectually called. Thirdly, There is a change from prophanene≈ø≈øe to profe≈ø≈øion, and yet this is a ≈øtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a ≈øaving change. Fourthly there is a ≈øtep from profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion into ≈øincerity, into a reall po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> Now tho≈øe three ≈øteps they fall ≈øhort of a ≈øaving change, and therefore every change of life doth not argue a man to be effectually called, becau≈øe there are many graduall chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that do not amount to ≈øo high a pitch as this, to be ≈øavingly changed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There may be a change in the life, when there is no change in the nature, or in the heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. they may <hi>wa≈øh the out ≈øide of the Cup, when within it is full of pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The life may be changed, the externall acts and cour≈øe may be changed, when the heart may not be changed, and the nature the ≈øame ≈øtill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There may be a great change in a mans life, proceeding, not from a change in their nature but from the times wherein they live: the times are changed, therefore they are changed; the times do not favour ≈øuper≈øtition, therefore they will not ≈øhew their ≈øuper≈øtitious hearts, the times countenance not profanene≈øs, therefore they will not be profane. Beloved, a change in a mans life may flow many times from a change of the times wherein they live, and yet this change, no Argument of a heart change, or of effectual calling by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A change in your life, may proceed from a change in your ≈øin not from a change in your heart: as thus, A man may be a Drunkard, may be an Adulterer, may be a profane liver in times pa≈øt, and may change the≈øe ≈øins for other ≈øins. He may change his Drunkenne≈øs into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou≈øne≈øs, and be a covetous Worldling. He may change his Adultery for Idolatry, and be a ≈øuper≈øtitious man. He may change Profanene≈øs into Hypocri≈øie, and be an Hypocritical man. He may change his loo≈øe practice into a loo≈øe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be an erroneous man. Now this is no change of the heart, but onely a change of the ≈øin; you have not the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115140:51"/>≈øame ≈øins you had, but you have other ≈øins in place of them; and men may thus have a change in their life, flowing from a change in their ≈øin, yet no argument of effectual calling. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.36. <hi>Why gadde≈øt thou ≈øo much to change thy way?</hi> The people of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> they would be alwaies chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, now they would be for God, anon for <hi>Baal;</hi> now for Gods true Wor≈øhip, anon for fal≈øe Wor≈øhip; they would be ever changing their ≈øin, but never leaving it; onely change their old ≈øins for other ≈øort of ≈øins. And ≈øo there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men now adaies changed, they are turned from Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and are come to be Profe≈ø≈øors; it may be they have not ≈øo gro≈øs ≈øins now, as in times pa≈øt; in times pa≈øt they would oppo≈øe Religion, and now they profe≈øs it; though they have left their oppo≈øition, they have ≈øome ≈øin more eminent then that. Many men have been loo≈øe in practice, they have changed that, to be loo≈øe in judgment; this is no change of heart all this while: ≈øo that, take this for a truth, there may be a change in the life, when the heart remains unchanged ≈øtill.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There may be a change in mens lives, ari≈øing from a change in the occa≈øions to ≈øin, and not from a change in the heart: As now, A Lion that will go ramping and roaring up and down, devouring his prey when he is at large; yet put this Lion in a Den, there he is quiet, and will offer no hurt: now the Lion is a Lion ≈øtill, and hath his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous di≈øpo≈øition ≈øtill, only he hath not ≈øo fair an occa≈øion to ≈øhew his rage. It is thus with men, many men want occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions and opportunities to ≈øhew their wickedne≈øs, and the evil of their natures, and therefore do not di≈øcover them: What's the rea≈øon many a man was a drunkard before, and is not ≈øo now? It may be drunkenne≈øs hath brought begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and now he hath not money to ≈øit upon an Ale-bench. What's the rea≈øon a man was an adulterer before, and is not ≈øo now? It may be he hath ≈øpent his ≈øtock, and ≈øpent his ≈øtrength upon Whores, and now he hath neither ≈øtrength nor pur≈øe to ≈øo low after them. It is no thanks to you, if God take away your occa≈øions of ≈øinning: men may be thus
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115140:52"/>changed, yet have no change in the heart at all.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Many men may change their lives, becau≈øe they come into better companie, haply their companie is better then in times pa≈øt; and this may work in them a change in their lives.
<note place="margin">2 Kin. 12.2.</note> As we read of <hi>Joa≈øh,</hi> all the while he was in <hi>Jehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s companie, he was a wel ordered man in his life; but when he was dead, and he came to have wicked men about him, then he ≈øhewed the wickedne≈ø≈øe of his heart.</p>
               <p n="7">7. La≈øtly, Everie change is not an evidence of effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, becau≈øe there may be a change in the life, proceeding from a wrong principle, and tending to a wrong end: As thus, a man may change his life from a wrong principle; what's that? I will name two wrong principles of a change in unconverted men. As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Men may change their lives, becau≈øe of ≈øome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent outward affliction, that lies upon them in this life; their afflictions may inforce them to change their waies, and not be ≈øo bad as in former daies, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.5. when they were in a ≈øtorm in the ≈øhip, <hi>every man went and prayed to his God.</hi> What a change was here? yet the change was onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of the danger, they were in danger of death, and therefore they grew religious: Every man when a danger and affliction lies upon him, that will make him betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to God and be a better minded man. And ≈øo <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when God ≈øent ten ≈øore plagues upon him, the plagues did inforce <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to confe≈øs his ≈øin, and beg of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to pray for him; and yet this change in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was onely becau≈øe of the pre≈øent affliction that lay upon him, which wrought this change, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.23. <hi>Oh Inhabitants of Lebanon, how gracious wilt thou be, when thy pangs ≈øhall come upon thee?</hi> When pangs and afflictions were upon them, then they would be a gracious people. There is many a man will change his life, when God brings pangs, and death, and ≈øickne≈øs upon him; the≈øe are forc'd waies that God takes, to make a wicked and ≈øtout-hearted wretch change his life, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 16.12. Its ≈øaid there, <hi>When Moab is weary, Moab will come to my Sanctuary and pray.</hi> What a change was here in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab?
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115140:52"/>Moab,</hi> an Idolatrous company, that hated Gods people, and were enemies to all goodne≈øs; yet when they were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Gods hand lay heavie upon them, then they would pray, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.12. So that you ≈øee clearly, though men do change their lives, yet if this change flow onely from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent affliction they lie under, that Gods hand upon them doth even force them to change their cour≈øe, this is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a ≈øaving change, and ≈øo by con≈øequence no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Men may change their cour≈øe from this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple al≈øo, Becau≈øe of that horror of con≈øcience that ≈øeizeth upon them, in the apprehen≈øion of hell, and the wrath of God; and from this Principle, a Heathen may change his cour≈øe. It is noted by one upon that place in <hi>Peter, It happens unto them, as the Dog that turns to his vomit, &amp;c.</hi> Upon tho≈øe words he hath this note; That the Dog in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, carries re≈øemblance to a wicked man leaving his ≈øin. Now ≈øaith this Author, The Dog when he vomits, it is by rea≈øon of ≈øome qualm and pang that is in his ≈øtomack, and when he hath that pang, he will di≈øgorge him≈øelf, and ea≈øe him≈øelf by vomit; not as if he loathed his meat, but if he could free him≈øelf from tho≈øe pangs, he would fain have the meat in his body to nouri≈øh him. Thus a wicked man, he may di≈øgorge and vomit up his ≈øins, and leave his ≈øins, but why? it is not becau≈øe he hates his ≈øins, no, he would keep them <hi>as a ≈øweet mor≈øel under his tongue;</hi> but it is becau≈øe tho≈øe ≈øins cau≈øe horror and trouble of con≈øcience, he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor he cannot follow his lu≈øts, but con≈øcience will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. Now if thou change thy ≈øin, onely to ≈øtop con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences mouth, and muzzle con≈øcience, this is no argument of effectual calling.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Delu≈ø. </seg>
                  </label> Fourthly, men are tempted by the Divel to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh pre≈øumptuous per≈øwa≈øions, that they are effectually called when they are not; becau≈øe they are mi≈øcalled and reproached by the men of this world. Now think they, I ≈øhould never be mi≈øcalled, and reproached by wicked men, if I were not called by my God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:115140:53"/>Now to take off this briefly, I an≈øwer: Every reproach from wicked men, can be no argument of an effectual call from God; becau≈øe men may be mi≈øcalled upon a twofold ground: There are ≈øome men <hi>≈øuffer as Chri≈øtians, and ≈øome as evil-doers;</hi> we may ≈øuffer either for Chri≈øts ≈øake, or for our own ≈øakes: The di≈øtinction is laid down 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15, 16, 17. <hi>Let none of you ≈øuffer as a Murtherer, as an evil doer, as a Theef, as a Bu≈øie body in other mens matters; but if any man ≈øuffer as a Chri≈øtian let him not be a≈øhamed.</hi> So that ≈øome men may be puni≈øhed for their own evils they have done, and ≈øo ≈øuffer no more then they have de≈øerved; but other men ≈øuffer for their profe≈ø≈øion, becau≈øe they profe≈øs Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Now to ≈øuffer becau≈øe of your evil doings, this can be no evidence; but to ≈øuffer for Chri≈øt, meerly for profe≈ø≈øing his Name; this is an argument of effectual calling. Therefore Chri≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth tho≈øe ble≈ø≈øed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are you when men ≈øhall revile you, and ≈øpeak evil of you for my ≈øake:</hi> This is an evidence of your effectual calling by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115140:54"/>a≈ø≈øurance of their own call? And in re≈øolution of this I ≈øhall briefly free it from two extreames, both of which are untrue about this Query.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt is that of the Papi≈øts, who utterly deny any ≈øuch thing as a≈ø≈øurance about a mans Calling, Ju≈øtification, or Election by God, and they hold all their followers in ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øe, affirming that the mo≈øt a man can have, is a conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctural faith; an hope or conjecture that he ≈øhall be ≈øaved. And hence it is, that in that Popi≈øh Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> they made this Canon;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Si quis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerit homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem rena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum teneri ex fide ad credendum ≈øe cert√≤ e≈ø≈øe ex numero Praede≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorum, anathema ≈øit.

That man that would ≈øo much as take this a≈ø≈øurance to him≈øelf, they would hold that man accur≈øed. And the rea≈øon why they do it, is, becau≈øe they hold another error, to wit, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from grace; which they could not maintain, did they not hold this al≈øo; this is the fir≈øt extream.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another extream is of the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> they being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øite to the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> in this point of a≈ø≈øurance, to confute them who deny all a≈ø≈øurance, they run into this extream, to hold that a≈ø≈øurance is of the nature of faith, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath faith, hath a≈ø≈øurance: but this is another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, and an uncomfortable doctrine for doubting Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, were it true. Therefore to keep this truth in the middle betwixt two extreames, I ≈øhall lay down this po≈øition by way of An≈øwer: That though ≈øometimes per≈øons effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, may be without a particular a≈ø≈øurance of their own call, yet this a≈ø≈øurance is attainable by Chri≈øtians in this life; and Chri≈øtians may be a≈ø≈øured of their own effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling. And this I ≈øhall prove by four Mediums.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe the Apo≈øtle injoynes it here in my Text, <hi>Give diligence to make your Calling and Election ≈øure.</hi> Now this is a rule in Divinity, No man is bound to do a thing impo≈ø≈øible, and therefore in that we are commanded and bound to do it, it is clear that it is po≈ø≈øible, and may be made ≈øure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:115140:54"/>Secondly, Becau≈øe it is the office of the Spirit of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, to work this particular a≈ø≈øurance in the hearts of tho≈øe that are effectually called, that they are in the ≈øtate of grace, and ≈øhall be brought to glory. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>We have received not the ≈øpirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> 1 John 5.10. <hi>He that believeth, he hath a witne≈ø≈øe in him≈øelfe;</hi> a witne≈ø≈øe to his own ≈øoul, that he doth believe. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13, 14.

It is called <hi>the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt of our inheritance.</hi> Now a ≈øeal, and earne≈øt, is to give more a≈ø≈øurance to a Promi≈øe; and here the Spirit of God is given to Believers as a Seal, and earne≈øt-Penny, that as they have the fir≈øt fruits in grace, they ≈øhall have their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øt in glory. 1 John 4.13. <hi>Hereby we know we dwell in him, and he in us, becau≈øe he hath given us his Spirit.</hi> It is the office of the Spirit of Je≈øus Chri≈øt to a≈ø≈øure our hearts in this particular. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ≈øelf beareth witnes with our ≈øpirits, that we are the children of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Particular ≈øervants of God in Scripture, that have been partakers of this mercy, they have had this firm a≈ø≈øurance of their effectual calling; I ≈øhall in≈øtance in three. Fir≈øt in <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Scripture tells us of him, that he had a clear evidence of his effectual calling, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chri≈øt liveth in me, who loved me, and gave him≈øelf for me.</hi> There he had a particular a≈ø≈øurance that Chri≈øt loved him, and gave him≈øelf for him. So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am per≈øwaded al≈øo, that what I have committed to him, he will keep till the la≈øt day.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have fini≈øhed my cour≈øe, I have kept the faith, henceforth there is a Crown laid up for me.</hi> Nay not onely <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Job</hi> al≈øo, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and I ≈øhall ≈øtand up before him at the last day:</hi> he knew Je≈øus Chri≈øt was his Redeemer. And ≈øo <hi>David</hi> al≈øo ≈øaith, <hi>Thou art my God, and I will prai≈øe thee. P≈øal.</hi> 118.28. and <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Surely the goodne≈ø≈øe and merey of God ≈øhall follow me all the dayes of my life.</hi> So that put
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115140:55"/>the≈øe together: God commands it, it is the ≈øpirits office to work a≈ø≈øurance in the heart, and particular ≈øervants of God have had this a≈ø≈øurance, therefore why may it not be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? But if you ≈øay, the≈øe were not ordinary ≈øervants of God, the≈øe were ≈øervants of a higher rank and form; but may ordinary weak Chri≈øtians know this al≈øo? Yes. Therefore,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Not only particular Saints have had this, but the people of God in General; they have declared in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that they have injoyed this particular a≈ø≈øurance of their effectual Calling and ≈øafety of their condition by Chri≈øt. In≈øtance in a few. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Doubtle≈ø≈øe thou art our Father.</hi> They made no doubt of it, they were ≈øo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded they feared it not. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 45.24. <hi>Surely ≈øhall one ≈øay, In the Lord have I righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe and ≈øtrength. Surely:</hi> a word of confidence, they were a≈ø≈øured they had righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe for their ju≈øtification in Chri≈øt Je≈øus. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>We know, that if our earthly Tabernacle be di≈ø≈øolved, we have a building of God eternal in the heavens.</hi> They knew that when they died, they ≈øhould ≈øee God in heaven; not only <hi>Paul,</hi> but other godly Chri≈øtians with him. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>You know in your ≈øelves, that God hath provided for you a better and more induring ≈øub≈øtance.</hi> They were a≈ø≈øured within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, that when they ≈øhould die, or lo≈øe their e≈øtates here, God had provided for them a more enduring ≈øub≈øtance. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>Hereby we know, that we are of the truth, and ≈øhall a≈ø≈øure our hearts before God.</hi> So ver≈øe 14. <hi>We know we are tran≈ølated from death to life, &amp;c.</hi> So that what can be more clearly proved then this, that this a≈ø≈øurance is to be attained in this life: becau≈øe God commands it, it is the ≈øpirits office to work it, particular Chri≈øtians have had it, and the people of God in general they have enjoyed and profe≈øt this Temper.</p>

                  </label> Is it ≈øo then that a≈ø≈øurance is attainable in this life? Then how much to blame are our adver≈øaries the <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> who hold their followers in ≈øu≈øpen≈øe, that they mu≈øt live without the a≈ø≈øurance of their own e≈øtate, that their ≈øoules mu≈øt hang in feares and doubts all their dayes, that the mo≈øt they can have is only a conjecture; oh into what a

Beloved, the Lord in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy, chap.</hi> 29. did pronounce it as a cur≈øe, that their lives ≈øhould hang in ≈øu≈øpen≈øe; it's a greater cur≈øe that mens ≈øouls ≈øhould hang in ≈øu≈øpen≈øe, that men ≈øhall not know whether they ≈øhall be ≈øaved or damned, it's a hell on this ≈øide hell; and therefore they are much to be blamed, that hold their followers in hand with a peradventure they ≈øhall be ≈øaved, peradventure not; when the Scripture is ≈øo clear in this thing.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly,  Let not the thoughts either of the impo≈ø≈øibility or the difficulty of attaining this a≈ø≈øurance, di≈øcourage you from looking after it. It is not impo≈ø≈øible, though it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult indeed; and the difficulty ≈øhould be ≈øo farre from di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging you, that it ≈øhould quicken your endeavours, to make your calling and election ≈øure.</p>

                  </label> Secondly, what is the rea≈øon that many Chri≈øtians who are called effectually by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, do live in many doubts and feares about their effectual calling?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doubt. </seg>
                  </label> In an≈øwer to this I ≈øhall lay down the≈øe three particulars, that the doubts that do ari≈øe in Chri≈øtians about their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they flow from this threefold fountain.</p>
               <p>Either fir≈øt, from ≈øome ≈øeeming defect, they apprehend in the manner of their calling. Or</p>
               <p>Secondly, ≈øome ≈øeeming defect they apprehend to be in the meanes of their calling. Or el≈øe</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ≈øome ≈øeeming defects they apprehend in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their calling; and the≈øe three grounds are the ri≈øe from whence many Chri≈øtians effectually called, do doubt of their call, and are not a≈ø≈øured of it.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, It doth ari≈øe from ≈øome ≈øeeming defect, they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be in the manner of their calling; They ≈øay I am not called in ≈øuch a manner as I ≈øee others are. As thus. Think
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115140:56"/>they, I ≈øee other men when they are converted, that their humiliations are great, I ≈øee that they have horror of con≈øcience, that they are wrought upon by the terrors of the law, that they are exceedingly humbled before God; Now for my part, I never found this manner of Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my ≈øoul, I never found that I could ≈øee my ≈øins clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or could be humbled for them greatly; I never found tho≈øe humiliations and legal Terrours which I hear many men talk of, and this makes me doubt, whether I am effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called or no. Now to take off this, I ≈øhall onely ≈øpeak three things by way of An≈øwer.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, That it is true, God doth proceed after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with ≈øome, yet God is not tied and confined to one and the ≈øame way of working with all. What if he come to you in a calm, when he comes to others in a Tempe≈øt, if God come to you in a more peaceable and quiet way? What if God do not pierce your heart, as he did tho≈øe 3000. in the <hi>Acts,</hi> if he kindely open thy heart like <hi>Lidia</hi>'s without noi≈øe? God is not to be tied to one and the ≈øame way in converting all. As 'tis ≈øaid, <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>The winde bloweth where it li≈øteth,</hi> ≈øo how it li≈øteth al≈øo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You have no cau≈øe to doubt for this, becau≈øe it's Gods u≈øual manner to proceed after this way, only with ≈øuch men who have been loo≈øe in their lives, who have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinate in their wills, who have been very ≈øcandalous in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation before their conver≈øion and call. But it is not Gods u≈øual way to work thus upon Chri≈øtians, who have been religiou≈øly brought up from their youth; it is not Gods way to dow≈øe them into ≈øuch a pit of horror, and plunge them into ≈øuch a depth of fears, that have been of a fair and ingenuous and moral life before their call. As you know it is with Carpenters, they give more blowes to knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Timber, then they will do to ≈ømooth and tender wood; thus doth God, when he meets with a knotty ≈øinner, a wretched ≈øtout-hearted ≈øinner, God mu≈øt give him many blowes by humiliation, before he will be humbled, before he can bring him to be a ≈øerviceable piece in Gods build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115140:56"/>whereas Chri≈øtians of a milde and ≈øofter temper, they ≈øhall have fewer blowes, and ≈øhall not have the terrors of God ≈øtick ≈øo fa≈øt in their hearts, as others ≈øhall. Hence you read that phra≈øe, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 6.5. Saith the Lord, <hi>I will hew them by my Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> God doth hew ≈øome men, hew them with judgments, and hew them with terror: Yea, but others that are not ≈øo loo≈øe as they; <hi>I taught Ephraim to go, I led Ephraim by the Armes, and I drew him with cords of a man, and with the bands of love, Ho≈ø.</hi> 11.4. God you ≈øee, would hack and hew ≈øome men with terror and wrath, but others he would draw with love, and the cords of a man. Now ≈øuppo≈øe God hath not hacked and hewed thee with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if God melt thee with loving kindne≈ø≈øe, and if God gain upon thy ≈øoul with mercy, and with love and grace, thou mu≈øt not blame God, thou mu≈øt not confine God; for this is Gods way of working ≈øometimes, as well as by wrath. God works upon ≈øome with wrath, he will allure others with loving kindne≈ø≈øe; ≈øo that you have no cau≈øe or ground of fear, that you are not effectually called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe you apprehend ≈øome defects in the manner of your call; becau≈øe it is Gods u≈øual way to plunge them in mo≈øt humiliation, and mo≈øt terrour, that have been mo≈øt wicked liv'd men before their call, and not ≈øo ordinarily with men religiou≈øly trained up from their youth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God, when he goes to call a ≈øinner to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, he looks upon the temper of tho≈øe that are to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and God ≈øees ≈øome men of a rugged Temper, that their Tempers will not be won, but by wrath, and by fire, and by hell, and by Judgement. And ≈øo it's like <hi>Felix</hi> was, his Temper was ≈øuch that nothing could convert him, but wrath and Judgement to come, Terrible Doctrines. Some are of this Temper, that nothing but wrath and hel-fire can work upon them. As children, there are ≈øome that are of ≈øuch ≈øoft, and tender Tempers, that the ≈øhaking of a rod may do them good; there are other children, if a man ≈øhould whip them every day, they would never leave their childi≈øh tricks: It is ≈øo with ≈øinners, God ≈øees ≈øome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115140:57"/>of a more tender and ≈øoft Temper that love will gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; others are of a rugged di≈øpo≈øition, that nothing but wrath can affright them; Now God in the di≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øations of his grace, he ob≈øerves their Temper, and if he ≈øeeth love will gaine more upon them, then wrath will do, he will take that cour≈øe; but if God ≈øee nothing but wrath, and fire, and horrour will do it, then he will work that way. This you read in the Epi≈øtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 22, 23. <hi>On ≈øome,</hi> ≈øaith the holy Gho≈øt, <hi>have compa≈ø≈øion, making a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; but others ≈øave with fear, pulling them out of the fire.</hi> The meaning is this, There are ≈øome that you mu≈øt ≈øhew ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈ø≈øe and compa≈ø≈øion to, in calling and working upon them, they are of a tender Temper; but others there are that you mu≈øt ≈øave with feare, that is, preach terrible Sermons to them, and fright them with hel-fire and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come. For God doth ob≈øerve the different Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in men, and hereupon doth proceed in different wayes of Admini≈øtration in working upon them. Now it may be, thou that do≈øt thus complaine, thou never had≈øt the≈øe Terrors in thy ≈øoul, and yet art effectually called, it may be God ≈øaw thy Temper more to be won by kindne≈ø≈øe, and more gained upon in a way of love, therefore wrought upon thee this way; God is not bound to one way: And therefore we may ju≈øtly count them blame-worthy who preach onely free grace, and Gods love, and ≈øo tie God to one Method; and they are to blame on the other ≈øide likewi≈øe (if there be any ≈øuch) that preach one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Terror and wrath; for God ob≈øerves the Temper of mens di≈øpo≈øitions, ≈øome to be knotty, and ≈øome ≈øoft, and accordingly proceeds in his way of working with them. This ground therefore for your doubts is in≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ≈øecond ground that makes men doubt of their effectual calling, is upon the apprehen≈øion of ≈øome ≈øeeming defect, that may be in the means of their calling. As thus; Think they, I have read in the Word, that it doth plea≈øe God to u≈øe preaching as the ordinary means
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115140:57"/>to call and convert ≈øinners to Chri≈øt. <hi>It plea≈øed God by preaching to ≈øave them that believe,</hi> I read this al≈øo that <hi>faith comes by hearing,</hi> (Now many a poore ≈øoul hath this that gravels his con≈øcience, and troubles his ≈øpirit.) but alas, I finde a defect in this means. For my part I cannot ≈øay I was converted by hearing a Sermon, that which did work upon me was ≈øome other means. One of the≈øe three, either I was converted (≈øaith one) by living in a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly family, among good Chri≈øtians, ≈øeeing their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that fir≈øt gained upon me; Or, ≈øaith another, I was gained upon by reading a Chapter in the Bible, or in ≈øome good book, and that fir≈øt wrought upon me; Or, ≈øaith a third, It may be, if it was the Word, it was the Word preached by a wicked man, that is now turned either erroneous in judgement, or prophane in practice: and this occa≈øioneth a great deal of Jealou≈øie. The Word preacht by the mouth of a godly Mini≈øter is Gods ordinary way, but I was altogether out of this way, and therefore this doth make him ≈øu≈øpect the truth of his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling. Now, Beloved, I be≈øeech you, lend me your thoughts a little for I would fain make this Doctrine as comfortable to every called one as I can. I ≈øhall ≈øpeak of all the≈øe in order, and ≈øhew you, that put ca≈øe either of the≈øe have been the means of thy calling, yet thou ha≈øt no rea≈øon to doubt of thine effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, thou ≈øu≈øpecte≈øt thy call, becau≈øe the meanes hath been, ≈øaye≈øt thou, not by hearing a Sermon, or the Word preacht, but by living among good Chri≈øtians, and ≈øeeing their example and their living, thou came≈øt by this meanes to love the wayes of God; and this was the fir≈øt meanes that converted thee. Beloved, I doubt not, but I ≈øpeak to a great many, that cannot ≈øay a Sermon ever converted them, but onely, that they were gained to Gods wayes, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth, this way: now what ≈øhall I ≈øay to ≈øuch men as the≈øe? why, I would ≈øay thus much; that though the Lord did not u≈øe his Word preached, the ordinary meanes of converting ≈øoules, in calling thee, yet God is not tied
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115140:58"/>and bound up to his Word preacht, but he may u≈øe other meanes to convert thy ≈øoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and more particularly, that living among good people, and ≈øeeing of their example both in life and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, we finde in Scripture to be a very efficacious means of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to convince, ≈øometimes to convert; and if you can finde out this in Scripture, you may have abundance of comfort. It hath been a meanes oftentimes to convince, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. <hi>They ≈øhall be a≈øhamed to ≈øpeak evill of you, while they behold your conver≈øation in Chri≈øt.</hi> When they ≈øhall ≈øee that you live in Chri≈øt, and walk according to Chri≈øt, they ≈øhall be a≈øhamed; a≈øhamed of what they have done, and what they have ≈øpoken; it ≈øhall convince them. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. And the Apo≈øtle when he ≈øpeaks of the orderly and regular managing the wor≈øhip of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. <hi>If there comes an unbeliever among you, &amp; he ≈øees your order,</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>he ≈øhall fall down in the mid≈øt of you, he ≈øhall be convinced, and ≈øhall ≈øay, Of a truth God is among you.</hi> Seeing this, (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) godly men holy in their lives, and holy in their wor≈øhip, though he be an unbeliever, he ≈øhall fall down and ≈øay, Of a truth God is among you: that is, by way of conviction. Nay further, ≈øometimes God doth ble≈ø≈øe the gracious lives, and blamele≈ø≈øe example of Chri≈øtians to be a means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert ≈øome, when the Go≈øpel cannot do it; and you would think this very comfortable, could it be made good. I would commend but one Text of Scripture to you, to prove what a ble≈ø≈øing it is to live in a good family, where either husband or wife, or any one in the family is godly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Wives be ≈øubject to your husbands,</hi> what then? <hi>that your husbands who are not wonne by the Word, may be wonne without the Word, while≈øt they behold the conver≈øation of their wives.</hi> A notable text, There were many wicked Hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, that all the Sermons they heard would not convert them; yet the Apo≈øtle tells them, that if the wife did live a godly and holy life, their lives ≈øometimes ≈øhould be more efficacious to convert their Husbands, then the Word ≈øhould be. And this, Beloved, doth clearly take off this fir≈øt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115140:58"/>plea of yours, that becau≈øe you were converted by example, and by living among good Chri≈øtians, and ≈øeeing their walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, this gained upon you; this is no cau≈øe of di≈øcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becau≈øe ≈øometimes, (I ≈øay) the Lord doth ble≈ø≈øe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of gracious lives, to make them winne and gain upon men that are brought home to Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they go yet further, There is another poore ≈øoul brought home to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and what ≈øaith he? I do mi≈ødoubt the means of my call, for a Sermon never wrought upon me, the fir≈øt thing of all that ever gained upon me, it was the reading of ≈øome Chapters in the Bible, or ≈øome other holy mans book, and that made me fir≈øt to hate ≈øin, and love the wayes of God, and look after his Word for my ≈øalvation. And here I doubt not but many Chri≈øtians have found the Word read, the fir≈øt means of gaining upon their hearts. And therefore to take off this likewi≈øe, I ≈øhall ≈øpeak two or three things in way of An≈øwer. As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, that God is not tied to any means, but can work with the meane≈øt means to bring home people to Je≈øus Chri≈øt. If <hi>Peters</hi> conver≈øion was by a Cock; a Cock crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a look of Chri≈øts eye, why may not Chri≈øt u≈øe the Scriptures read to be a means of a mans call? If from ≈øtones God can rai≈øe up children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> why cannot <hi>God</hi> do it by the Word al≈øo? to make the Word read a means in his own hands to effect it? God that can do all things with nothing, without means, can bring to pa≈ø≈øe great things by weak means.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and more particularly, That though ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily preaching, and hearing of the Word preached be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, and crowned by him chiefly to be a means in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to convert ≈øouls, yet God ≈øometimes hath ble≈øsed the reading of the Word to be a means of converting ≈øouls likewi≈øe. Yet Beloved, I would not do as the Prelates did, who would fain have brought in reading to ju≈øtle out preaching. Preaching is the more noble work, and mu≈øt be highe≈øt in our thoughts, yet if God will go out in an unu≈øual way, who can controll him? If God will do it by a Chapter,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115140:59"/>read, when not by a Sermon preached, who can re≈øi≈øt God? if he will ≈øhew his power by weaker means. Who ≈øhall gain≈øay it? God ≈øometimes honours the reading of the Word, to give encouragement to reading, to be a means of ≈øome mens call. I have read of S. <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> that he was converted not by hearing a Sermon, but by opening the Bible, and reading that place. <hi>Rom</hi> 13.13. <hi>Let us walk hone≈øtly as in the day time, not in rioting and drunkenne≈ø≈øe, not in chambering and wantonne≈ø≈øe:</hi> and the reading of this ver≈øe wrought upon him. I have read of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that he was converted by reading the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of <hi>Jonas,</hi> hearing of Gods mercy to ≈øave ≈øuch a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, and of Gods mercy to <hi>Jonas,</hi> when he was in ≈øo petti≈øh a mood as to be angry with God. I have known like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe another famous Mini≈øter, that going by a Book-binders ≈øhop, he was converted by reading a Sermon of Repentance that co≈øt but two pence; &amp; hath bin a famous Mini≈øter ≈øince for the conver≈øion of many hundreds to Je≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>Junius</hi> was converted by reading the fir≈øt of <hi>John;</hi> ≈øo the Eunuch was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by reading <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 53.7. Beloved, God is not bound up to any one way in ≈øaving man; He that wrought upon <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> by a ver≈øe reading &amp; upon another by a Sermon, he can do ≈øo by thee Reading is an ordinance of God, and God is not bound up, but may u≈øe that as ameans of thy effectual call likewi≈øe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Yea but, ≈øaith another doubting ≈øoul, Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture I was never wrought upon, neither by ≈øeeing god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people among whom I lived, and ob≈øerving their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor was I wrought upon by reading good books; but I was fir≈øt wrought upon by hearing ≈øuch a Mini≈øter, that I now ≈øee is run into error; or a Mini≈øter that is grown loo≈øe in his practice (happily in the≈øe pre≈øent times gone to joyne with the enemy again≈øt the Kingdom,) and become a wicked and vile liver; and the Mini≈øter being bad that wrought upon me, makes me que≈øtion, whether the work be not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øound and bad work al≈øo, and this gravels many a Chri≈øtian likewi≈øe. To which I an≈øwer briefly,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, That ≈øuppo≈øe the Mini≈øter were bad that wrought upon thee, yet the badne≈ø≈øe of the Mini≈øter is no ju≈øt ground
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115140:59"/>of making us ≈øu≈øpect our calling. For then we ≈øhould never be ≈øure of our call. A man may be ≈øure of his own conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, though a man may not be ≈øure of the conver≈øion, of him by who≈øe means he was called.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Again it is clear in Scripture, God may u≈øe Mini≈øters that are wicked them≈øelves to convert others. The Mini≈øters of the ≈øeven Churches of <hi>A≈øia,</hi> doubtle≈ø≈øe ≈øome of them were bad men; <hi>Paul</hi> tells you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>I keep under my body, le≈øt when I preach to others, I my ≈øelf may be a ca≈øtaway.</hi> Intimating, that a man may preach to others, and may be a means to ≈øave others, and yet not be ≈øaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. Mini≈øters in this ca≈øe may be as Cooks are. A Cook may dre≈ø≈øe many a di≈øh, and let them go through his hands to furni≈øh a large and ≈øtately Table, yet of all the≈øe di≈øhes him≈øelf hardly ta≈øte one; So Mini≈øters, they may dre≈ø≈øe many a di≈øh for their hearers, yet they not lick their fingers, or ta≈øte of this ≈øpiritual food them≈øelves. As in the building of the Ark, there were many men built <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, to ≈øave others, that were drowned them≈øelves; ≈øo many men may build an Ark by preaching the Word, and the wayes of God to ≈øave other mens ≈øoules, when they may be drowned them≈øelves. Hence it is the Scripture tells us of Starres that fell from Heaven; many Mini≈øters, that ≈øeemed godly Mini≈øters, like Starres in their Generation, yet they fell, and became wicked and loo≈øe. And I remember Doctor <hi>Pembleton</hi> a famous Mini≈øter in the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and a man who≈øe Mini≈øtry had converted many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, yet at length he him≈øelf turned to be a Papi≈øt. Now the≈øe Chri≈øtians did never mi≈ødoubt or ≈øu≈øpect their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, becau≈øe the man that converted them, was a bad man; They might be good people, though he was a bad Mini≈øter: ≈øo that this is no ground in the world; though I confe≈ø≈øe it is not ordinary, that God makes wicked men meanes of conver≈øion, but God ordinarily crowns the Word mo≈øt in the mouth of a godly Mini≈øter, yet ≈øometimes I ≈øay, God may u≈øe a wicked man to be a means to convert ≈øoules. And I would give you the≈øe rea≈øons to prove, that a wicked
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115140:60"/>man may convert ≈øoules, and that God ties not conver≈øion onely to a godly Mini≈øter. Becau≈øe fir≈øt, the efficacy of the Word doth not depend upon man, but upon Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and Chri≈øt may make u≈øe of whom he plea≈øeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If only a good man could convert, then this would follow, that we could be as well ≈øure of another mans conver≈øion, as we are of our own; which is a thing mo≈øt untrue. For if only a godly man could convert, then if I were ≈øure of my own conver≈øion, I were as well ≈øure of his conver≈øion that wrought upon me al≈øo; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, ≈øo that clearly this ≈øhould lay no block in your way, becau≈øe you di≈øcern the Mini≈øter that wrought upon you to be no good man, ≈øeeing conver≈øion is not tied onely to a godly Mini≈øter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a third ground from whence doubts ari≈øe in called ones, is from ≈øome ≈øeeming defects they apprehend to be in the concomitants that accompany, or in the effects that ≈øhould follow effectual calling: and this makes them fear, that ≈øure they are not effectually called. I will name to you three or four.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, (≈øaith a doubting Chri≈øtian) I do hear in Scripture what effects will follow, and what will accompany a man effectually called, and I find them not wrought in my ≈øoul. As now fir≈øt. I apprehend that when a man is effectually called, he ≈øhall be inabled by God to call upon him in prayer: I finde in Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. That <hi>all that are called to be Saints, they ≈øhall call upon the Lord in every place;</hi> but alas, wo is me, I do not find this in my ≈øoul. I find I have a dull, dead, li≈øtle≈ø≈øe, unpraying heart all the dayes of my life; and therefore I doubt whether I am effectually called or no. Now to this I ≈øhall lay down three things for an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, peradventure you judge that you are not enabled to pray, becau≈øe you want expre≈ø≈øions in prayer, though you have affections. Now if you judge your inability to pray, becau≈øe you want expre≈ø≈øions only, you judge ami≈ø≈øe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe prayer is to be judged by the affections, not by the expre≈ø≈øions. Expre≈ø≈øions they are but the breath of nature,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115140:60"/>a natural voluble tongue may tumble out expre≈ø≈øions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as affections in prayer, they are the breath and fruit of the holy Spirit. Therefore do not judge you cannot pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe you have not ≈øuch fluent expre≈ø≈øions as others u≈øe, for the very e≈ø≈øence of a prayer lies in the heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ≈øaid, when the Spirit of God teacheth men to pray, it teacheth them not only in expre≈ø≈øions, but <hi>with ≈øighs and groans that cannot be uttered. Rom.</hi> 8.26. When the Spirit moves the heart, and makes you ≈øigh out your reque≈øts, and ≈øorrow out your ≈øupplications, you pray be≈øt of all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you that judge your inability to pray, and therefore think you are not called, becau≈øe you cannot call upon God, I would ≈øay this unto you: That the be≈øt of Gods children have found a great difference in their ≈øpirits in reference to praying duties; the be≈øt of Gods children do not alwayes pray alike. Sometimes the affections of godly men are as ≈øwift in prayer, as the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab;</hi> otherwhiles they drive as heavily as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots when the wheels were off. Sometime the people of God are burning in their affections, hot as fire; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles they are frozen in their affections, cold as ice. None of Gods people are in their carriage alwayes alike towards God in prayer. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 77.4. It is the ≈øpeech of <hi>A≈øaph, O Lord, my ≈øpirit is overwhelmed within me, I am ≈øore troubled, I cannot ≈øpeak.</hi> The man was ≈øo troubled, he could not ≈øpeak, yet <hi>A≈øaph</hi> ≈øpake the≈øe words with his mouth; but the meaning is, though <hi>A≈øaph</hi> was a godly man, yet he was ≈øo overwhelmed with trouble, he could not ≈øpeak to God, he could not call upon God with that inward vigor of ≈øpirit. Though thou maye≈øt ≈øometime call upon God with affection, yet when trouble re≈øts upon thee, thy heart may be out of frame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, many times Gods people are ≈øubject to a ≈øtate of de≈øertion, and abatements in their ≈øpiritual affections, and then they are out of a praying vein; when you loo≈øe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the wheels of prayer are knocked off. Many times it falls out with Gods people, that they are even brought into
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115140:61"/>a langui≈øhing and low condition, they are in ≈øuch a ≈øwoune as if they had neither a principle, nor the actings of ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. ver≈øe 2. <hi>Strengthen that which remaines,</hi> ≈øaith the holy Gho≈øt; <hi>that is ready to die.</hi> Godly people may bee a dying people, and then the tongue failes, when it is a dying: the people of God may be in a dying condition; though they never die wholly in grace, yet they may be ≈øo weakned in their ≈øpirits, that they cannot poure out their reque≈øts to God as in wonted time. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Jeho≈øaphat he walked in the fir≈øt wayes of David his father:</hi> implying that <hi>Davids</hi> fir≈øt wayes were better then his la≈øt. So many men may have their fir≈øt wayes good, yet ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the end before they die, they may have much fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deadne≈ø≈øe of ≈øpirit upon them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If a man doth but mourn, that he cannot call upon God, God looks upon that as calling upon him. If you can but ≈øigh out your reque≈øts, and mourn that you cannot mourn, and pray that you might pray; the Lord hears your prayer. This is the mo≈øt melodious mu≈øick you can make in the eares of God. Therefore <hi>David</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping:</hi> There is a voice in Teares, as well as in Words. If the Lord ≈øee thee to weep over thine own ≈øtraitne≈ø≈øe, and mourn over thine own dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, the Lord looks upon this with a more plea≈øing eye, then if thou could≈øt poure out the inlargements of thy tongue, with mo≈øt fluent and voluble expre≈ø≈øions.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Doctrine which I am yet upon is this, <hi>That Chri≈øtians ought to put forth a great deal of diligence to make this ≈øure to their ≈øouls, that they are effectually called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> In the pro≈øecution of which I have gone over many particulars, and an≈øwered ≈øome doubts, in re≈øerence to godly men who are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called. As fir≈øt, in regard of ≈øome ≈øeeming defects they apprehend to be in the manner of their calling. Secondly, in the means of their calling. And thirdly, (which I am yet upon,) of ≈øome defects they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend about the concomitants that accompany tho≈øe that are effectually called, of which I have ≈øpoken onely of one in particular, to wit, that they cannot call upon God in prayer; I now pa≈ø≈øe to the ≈øecond.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They apprehend that tho≈øe that are effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, they have this to accompany their calling, that they are brought out of a ≈øtate of ignorance into a ≈øtate of knowledge, out of a ≈øtate of darkne≈ø≈øe into a ≈øtate of light; hence they will urge this again≈øt them≈øelves, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Ye are to ≈øhew forth the prai≈øes of him, who hath call'd you out of darkne≈ø≈øe into his marvellous light.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. He ≈øent forth his Word <hi>to call them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Now ≈øaith the poor ≈øoul, Alas, I do not finde this concomitant to be in my heart, I do not finde this marvellous light the Scripture here ≈øpeaks of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 6. Alas, my heart is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115140:62"/>like a dungeon of darkne≈ø≈øe, and like a hou≈øe that hath no inlets, no windows to let in the Sun-≈øhine of the Go≈øpel upon it: and many times this gravelleth many a godly minde. Now to tho≈øe that make this doubt, I ≈øhall onely ≈øpeak two or three things to take it off.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, to you that make this complaint, I would ≈øay this: that tho≈øe that know mo≈øt, they know but little in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteries of Chri≈øt; as you are not perfect in other graces, ≈øo you are not here perfect in knowledg; <hi>You know but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.9. therefore you have no need to be di≈øcouraged at this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and more particularly, you that complain of ignorance; though you are ignorant, and cannot finde that marvellous light ≈øhine in your ≈øouls, which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect, yet if your ignorance have not the≈øe three ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, you may re≈øt confident your ignorance will never prove a damning ≈øinne unto you, but it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with your effectual calling; As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, If you ignorance be not a ≈øtubborne and wilfull ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Secondly, If it be not a ≈øotti≈øh and bruti≈øh ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. And thirdly, If it be not a fundamental ignorance.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, If it be not a ≈øtubborne and wilfull ignorance. Though you are ignorant, yet if you are willing to learn, and know the wayes of God revealed in his Word, ≈øuch an ignorance will never damne you: But when ignorance comes to be wilful, that a man doth not know, and he will not learne; a man is an ignorant man yet he thinks he knows more then all the Preachers can tell him; this is a ≈øad ≈øigne you are not effectually called. Hence you read, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22. <hi>How long, ye ≈øimple ones, will you love ≈øimplicity, &amp;c?</hi> Godly people may be in a ≈øtate of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but they love it not; therefore, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. the Scripture tells us of wicked men, that <hi>they are wilfully ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</hi> So that if your ignorance have not this bad quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it, to be a ≈øtubborne and wilfull ignorance, it may ≈øtand with your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Provided that your ignorance be not a ≈øotti≈øh and bruti≈øh ignorance; that is, that you do not ≈øo lie cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115140:62"/>in a ≈øtate of darkne≈ø≈øe, that you are uncapable to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the goodne≈ø≈øe of the Word, and uncapable to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend any thing that is taught you; that you are not like tho≈øe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.22. <hi>My people have no under≈øtanding, they are a ≈øotti≈øh people, wi≈øe to do evil, but to do good they have no under≈øtanding.</hi> Many men are ignorant men, yet not ≈øo ≈øotti≈øhly ignorant, as not to be capable of learning; if you will teach him, he is willing to be in≈øtructed; but ≈øome men are ≈øo ignorant, they are not capable of learning; you may as well teach a block as them. Hence it is the Prophet complains, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 1.4. <hi>The Oxe knows his owner, and the A≈ø≈øe his Ma≈øters Crib, but I≈ørael knows not the Lord his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In ca≈øe your ignorance be not a fundamental ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, I mean ≈øuch an ignorance, as not to know tho≈øe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary and fundamental points in the Word, that mu≈øt be known, if ever you be ≈øaved; as about Je≈øus Chri≈øt and ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ju≈øtification by his blood, and faith in his Name, &amp;c. though you may be ignorant about circum≈øtantials, yet if it be not in fundamentals, your ignorance may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with effectual calling. But now</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a godly man be ≈øatisfied in the≈øe two points, and thinks happily, I may have the fir≈øt concomitant, to call upon God, and ≈øo evidence my effectual call; and then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the ≈øecond may not be wanting in me, that I do not lie under the ≈øtate of a wilful ≈øotti≈øh &amp; fundamental ignorance. But alas, ≈øaith he, I want a third concomitant that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies effectual calling, and that is; I finde in the Word, that they that are effectually called, they are brought into an Obediential frame of heart to all the wayes of God, that whatever God commands them to do, their hearts can readily obey, and this I finde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>God hath called them by his grace unto the obedience of faith.</hi> Now alas, ≈øaith a poore ≈øoul. I finde a defect in this concomitant likewi≈øe, I cannot di≈øcerne that I am called to an obedience flowing from faith as its principle, I cannot finde this frame of heart to be in me, and therefore I doubt of my effectual calling This I ≈øhall labour to take off likewi≈øe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:115140:63"/>Fir≈øt, When I ≈øay that obedience is a concomitant that will accompany one effectually called, I do not ≈øay nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it of obedience in the actings of it, but of an obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial frame of ≈øpirit in the purpo≈øes of it. Many men may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called,
<note place="margin">In praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione animi.</note> when they may not alwayes live in the acting of obedience to Chri≈øt but every man effectually called hath an obedient frame of heart; that is, he hath purpo≈øes &amp; inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and re≈øolutions to obey God, though he cannot act what he would do; he hath obedience in the habit, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his purpo≈øes and re≈øolutions always attending him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you finde in Scripture, that the ≈øtronge≈øt and able≈øt Chri≈øtians who have done mo≈øt for God, have ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been very defective in the Actings of obedience, that they could not do what they would do for God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> complaines, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>The good that we would do, we cannot do. Paul</hi> him≈øelf that was a pillar in Gods hou≈øe, yet he tells you, he could not go out in tho≈øe Actings of obedience, which in his heart he would do; &amp; therfore if you would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly do more then you do, God accepts of the litle you do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though you cannot put forth many Actings of obedience to God; where there is readine≈ø≈øe of minde and heart, God accepts the purpo≈øes of the minde for the Action it ≈øelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Where there is a willing minde, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, as if the deed were done.</hi> And thus much be ≈øpoken to the ≈øecond ca≈øe of con≈øcience, why men effectually called do ≈øo much doubt of their own call.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doubt. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, Seeing Chri≈øtians mu≈øt put forth diligence in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their calling ≈øure; therefore now whereabouts mu≈øt this diligence of ours be conver≈øant? or into what Channel mu≈øt our diligence run, that ≈øo we might be ≈øure of our effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling? This is a very material que≈øtion; and in re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, I ≈øhall an≈øwer it in the≈øe two generals.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, if you would get a≈ø≈øurance of your effectual calling, you mu≈øt put forth diligence to remove tho≈øe things that will hinder you in making ≈øure your calling. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, u≈øe diligence to ≈øet upon the practice of tho≈øe duties that may further you in making this ≈øure, that you are effectually called.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:115140:63"/>Fir≈øt, You mu≈øt remove tho≈øe things which do much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from being a≈ø≈øured, and tho≈øe hinderances that are to be removed, I ≈øhall comprize under ≈øix heads; As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, you mu≈øt u≈øe diligence to remove Melancholy from your Thoughts; This is a natural hinderance of a≈ø≈øurance. Melancholy is a temper in man ari≈øing from a black blood running about the body, that doth naturally occa≈øion di≈øtru≈øt and fear in mens mindes; this temper being in the body, doth work much upon the di≈øpo≈øition of the ≈øoul. Now if your temper be Melancholy, and ≈øo di≈øpo≈øe you to di≈øtru≈øt and fear, this will be a great ≈øtop to your having of the joyes and comforts of the Lord in your hearts, in a≈ø≈øurance of his love. It is a note <hi>Perkins</hi> hath upon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when he are gra≈ø≈øe like a bea≈øt; he writing upon that place thinks, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was in a deep Melancholy, and that did ≈øo po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe him, that he could not tell whether he was a man or a bea≈øt, though ≈øaith he, he did not eat gra≈ø≈øe, but his deep perplexity ≈øeazing upon him did make him think that he was from a man turned into a Bea≈øt. Beloved, Melancholy in a Chri≈øtian, it will make him think him≈øelf an Hypocrite, when he is a Saint; and therefore take heed of a Melancholy, lumpi≈øh and ≈øad temper; it is a very great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to this grace of a≈ø≈øurance. This I lay down only as a Natural remedy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A minde filled with worldly cares, and running into incumbring imployments in the world, this is a great hinderance of a≈ø≈øurance. The cares of this life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. are compared to thornes. Now thornes they choake the ≈øeed, by drawing the juyce that is in the ≈øeed to them≈øelves, and ≈øo the corn doth not grow, where thornes ≈øpring. The cares of this life, they are like thornes in this, they are of an attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power, to ≈øuck and draw the juyce of your ≈øpirits and comforts to them≈øelves, ≈øo that you cannot have the juyce of your ≈øpirits in gathering your evidences for heaven; the more incumbred you are in the world, the le≈ø≈øe clear you will be touching the evidence of your everla≈øting condition; The cares of this life, <hi>they pierce the ≈øoul through with many
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115140:64"/>≈øorrowes.</hi> Now when a man is pierced with many ≈øorrows, he is in a very unfit temper to be rai≈øed up in ≈øpiritual joy; the more you encumber your ≈øelves in the employments of this world, the le≈øs you wil be in the comforts of heaven. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it was the ≈øpeech of a Pope when he lay a dying, When I was a painful preaching Mini≈øter, then I had hopes of my ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; when I came to be a Cardinal, I doubted of it: but when I came to be a Pope, I de≈øpaired of it; I was ≈øo entangled in the Affairs of this life: Beloved, ≈øo I may ≈øay to you, When you were but ordinary Chri≈øtians in the world, you were in a way to get a≈ø≈øurance of your ≈øalvation, but ≈øince you have been taken up with the affaires of the world, it doth ≈øo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtract your minde, that you can be in no compo≈øed temper to have any ≈øetledne≈ø≈øe of heart about your everla≈øting e≈øtate. It is the ob≈øervation of Philo≈øophers, that the Sun is eclip≈øed by the interpo≈øition of the Moon, the Moon coming between the Sun and our ≈øight: Beloved, the Sun of your comforts comes to be eclip≈øed by the Moon, (which is made an Emblem of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9.) Now if the Moon of the world comes between your comforts and you, it will mi≈øerably darken and eclip≈øe your comforts to you. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world doth ≈øo impede your comfort in a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as incumbring and carking cares about the things of this world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Take heed you do not harbour the guilt of any one known ≈øin upon your con≈øcience. Keeping of ≈øin upon the con≈øcience, is a great impediment to your inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. You will never be a≈ø≈øured while you do thus; and therefore if ever you would have a≈ø≈øurance, remove this. It is an ob≈øervation of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hilder≈øham</hi> upon <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 51.12, 14.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115140:64"/>while <hi>David</hi> lo≈øt the joyes of the Spirit, and lo≈øt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Heaven; And therefore when he comes to renew his comforts, and re≈øtore his a≈ø≈øurance, he doth with begging of God for a≈ø≈øurance, beg of God al≈øo to deliver him from blood-guiltine≈ø≈øe; as knowing, that if this ≈øin ≈øhould be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on con≈øcience unrepented of, and unpardoned, he ≈øhould never have the joyes of Gods Spirit re≈øtored. Beloved, you will never have a≈ø≈øurance of your effectual calling, till your con≈øciences are freed from having ≈øin upon them with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. It is an ob≈øervation that <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> hath about earth-quakes, that they are occa≈øioned by rea≈øon of winde got into the Caverns and hollow places of the earth; which having no place for vent again, it makes ruptures, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes hou≈øes and mountaines and all before it: Sin upon the con≈øcience unrepented of, is like winde in the earth, it will make a heart quake there, that there ≈øhall not be that calmne≈ø≈øe, and quietne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øetledne≈ø≈øe of minde which there would be, were ≈øinne away. Hence we read, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 33.16. <hi>The ≈øinners in Sion are afraid, and fearfulne≈ø≈øe hath ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øed the Hypocrite,</hi> The ≈øinners are afraid; tho≈øe who had guilt upon them, their ≈øins bred terrour and ≈øeare; and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites that are con≈øcious to them≈øelves of their own guilt, fearfulne≈ø≈øe ≈øurprizeth them, but the upright and ≈øincere in heart were not ≈øo; To note that this is a great enemy to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace, and to a≈ø≈øurance about your everla≈øting e≈øtate, if ≈øo be you harbour ≈øin upon the con≈øcience unrepented of. And it is ju≈øt with God it ≈øhould be ≈øo; becau≈øe if you keep ≈øin in your hearts, that will be ever jarring with heaven, it is ju≈øt with God to be at oddes with you.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Avoid the ca≈øting of your eye, in a way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, upon others, who are more eminent in grace then you, and have got a precedencie of you in the wayes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe. 'Tis true indeed, a man that is given to ≈øpiritual pride, and ≈øelfe-conceitedne≈ø≈øe touching his own goodne≈ø≈øe, it is fit that he ≈øhould look upon tho≈øe that have a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie before him in grace, the more to humble him: But for a man that lies under trouble of minde, and doubtings touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115140:65"/>his everla≈øting e≈øtate, that man ≈øhould not look upon others more eminent then he in grace, becau≈øe it will rather increa≈øe di≈øcomforts, then any way work a≈ø≈øurance in you. If you look upon the glittering beames of the Sun ≈øhining in its full ≈øtrength, the more you look upon that orient and re≈øplendent body, the more it will dazle your eyes, that you can behold but dimly things upon the earth: It is ≈øo with Chri≈øtians; ≈øome Chri≈øtians they ≈øhine like ≈øo many Suns in the firmament, their graces do ≈øo ≈øhine and ≈øparkle, that if you look upon them, they will even dazle your eyes, and make you blinde, that you cannot ≈øee tho≈øe ≈ømall ≈øcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ≈øparks of grace that are in your own hearts. In ca≈øe therefore you would get a≈ø≈øurance, avoid the ca≈øting of your eye too much upon tho≈øe that have a precedencie in grace before you.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take heed you make not ≈øen≈øe and feeling the Touch≈øtone to try your effectual calling by; ≈øen≈øe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will deceive you in the matters of your calling. I may allude to that pa≈ø≈øage in the book of <hi>Gene≈øis:</hi> you know old <hi>I≈øaac</hi> was dimme-≈øighted, and by rea≈øon of his old age, he ran into a mi≈øtake by feeling; He had <hi>Jacob</hi> by the hand, and by feeling thought it had been <hi>E≈øau.</hi> Beloved, many of us are dimme-≈øighted in our comforts, and in our graces, and if we tru≈øt to feeling, we may be deceived as <hi>I≈øaac</hi> was. You may think when you have <hi>Jacob</hi> by the hand, I mean grace in the heart, that it is but an <hi>E≈øau,</hi> it is but a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Therefore take heed of making ≈øen≈øe and feeling the Touch≈øtone to try your calling by. A childe is born, yet knowes not that it is born; lives, yet knowes not that it lives; but tho≈øe about it do: ≈øo a Chri≈øtian may be born again, live the life of grace, and yet not be ≈øen≈øible of it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Give diligence to remove this hinderance, to wit, Pride in your gifts, and dependance upon your graces. Pride and dependance, they are not onely murderers of comforts, but they murder our graces al≈øo; and if God ≈øees you ≈øwell with pride, becau≈øe you abound in grace, he will ≈øoon prick that ≈øwelling bladder. It is the ob≈øervation of a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115140:65"/>Modern Divine, that exaltings of ≈øpirit after a≈ø≈øurance at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it will inevitably expo≈øe a Chri≈øtian, either to great di≈øcomforts, or to great ≈øins. Hence the Scripture makes mention, that Pride of your gifts is not onely an enemy to comfort, but an enemy to grace; not onely an enemy to the comforts from grace, but to the very having of grace. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>If a mans heart be exalted, his ≈øpirit is not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right within him.</hi> James 4.6. <hi>God re≈øi≈øts the proud,
<note place="margin">Job 40.7.</note> and gives grace to the humble.</hi> So that pride is not onely an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to your comforts, but to the very getting of grace like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe; when the branches of a vine grow luxuriant, they ≈øhall have the pruning hook. And thus you have the fir≈øt ≈øort of helps laid down to you; In ca≈øe you would get a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance, you mu≈øt u≈øe diligence to avoid tho≈øe things that may be a hinderance to you in getting a≈ø≈øurance of your call.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ≈øecond ≈øort of helps in ca≈øe you would get a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance, is to u≈øe diligence in the practice of tho≈øe things that may be helps and furtherances to the obtaining of a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance about your effectual calling. And here I ≈øhall name onely ≈øix or ≈øeven particulars</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Exalt arguments of faith again≈øt pre≈øent feelings; If ≈øo be that you will once enter the li≈øts to di≈øpute with the devil, he will out-cavill you, and <hi>Non-plus</hi> you. The devil is a cunning Logician, and it is not ≈øafe, ≈øaith D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Pre≈øton,</hi> to argue with the devil; the devil will out-di≈øpute, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argue you. It is a Chri≈øtians work to exalt arguments of Faith again≈øt pre≈øent feelings. In ca≈øe you would get a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, you are to do as <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful did, when he was to believe a thing that ≈øen≈øe and rea≈øon would tell him ≈øhould never come to pa≈ø≈øe; It is ≈øaid of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19. That <hi>in hope he believed again≈øt hope.</hi> He would exalt faith again≈øt ≈øen≈øe. And how was it? God promi≈øed <hi>Abraham</hi> a childe; rea≈øon and ≈øen≈øe would have told <hi>Abraham, Abraham,</hi> thou art a hundred yeers old, thy wife ninety nine, her womb is barren, and it is not likely you ≈øhould have children; but <hi>Abraham</hi> would not argue thus,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115140:66"/>but would exalt arguments of faith, and apply Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes, and Gods Word, exalting the≈øe; <hi>Abraham</hi> did believe in hope again≈øt hope. Beloved, ≈øo mu≈øt you: though you ≈øay you have barren wombs, Grace is not likely to grow in you, and though you are old, and decrepit, &amp; feeble Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, yet advance arguments of faith from Gods love, and from Gods power, and from Gods Providence, and Gods Promi≈øes, and that's the way to get your comforts clear and full. I may apply what <hi>Fox</hi> in his Acts and Monuments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of a poor woman, that was called before <hi>Bonner,</hi> and the re≈øt in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign that ≈øate in Judgement about her Religion; they ≈øee her, though a poor and ≈øilly woman, yet keep firm to her principles, and would not deny her Religion. At length <hi>Bonner</hi> ≈øent ≈øome learned Doctors to di≈øpute with her, and argue the ca≈øe about ≈øome points ≈øhe held; they coming to ≈øee her, ≈øhe puts them off with this ≈øaying, Well, you are Scholars, and you come to di≈øpute; I mu≈øt needs tell you, I cannot di≈øpute, but I can burn for my Religion. Beloved, I would have you an≈øwer the devil thus. If he comes to outwit and cavill with you about your comforts, ≈øay you cannot di≈øpute, but you can believe; you can lay your help on Je≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>upon one that is mighty,</hi> and exalt arguments of faith, and this will much ≈øtrengthen your comforts. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.42. <hi>There came a Ruler to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and be≈øought him for his daughter that lay a dying;</hi> and while he was telling Chri≈øt this, there came ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther me≈ø≈øenger after, and told him, <hi>Thy daughter is dead, trouble the man no farther:</hi> what ≈øaith Chri≈øt hearing this? <hi>Fear not, onely believe.</hi> As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, ≈øen≈øe and rea≈øon would have told him it were a needle≈ø≈øe thing to beg of Chri≈øt for his daughter when ≈øhe was dead; but ≈øaith Chri≈øt, Do not ≈øtoop to ≈øen≈øe and rea≈øon, <hi>Fear not, onely believe,</hi> and the work ≈øhall be done: So I ≈øay to you, Con≈øult not with fle≈øh and blood, but exalt arguments of faith again≈øt pre≈øent feelings; and this is the way to get a≈ø≈øurance of your comforts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Keep con≈øcience clear, that no ≈øin be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115140:66"/>there, and you are in the way to get your comforts full. <hi>God,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>David,</hi> P≈øal. 85.8. <hi>will ≈øpeak peace to his people, but they mu≈øt not return unto folly.</hi> As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, though God doth ≈øpeak peace, and a≈ø≈øure you of your pardon and ≈øalvation; yet if you return to ≈øin, God can tell how to break your peace, and turn his ≈ømiles into frowns and angry looks. Take heed of ≈øin, and keep your con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence clear, and that's the way to have peace ≈øetled in your hearts. <hi>Job</hi> 11.14, 15. <hi>If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedne≈ø≈øe dwell in thy Tabernacle.</hi> What followes? <hi>and then ≈øhalt thou lift up thy face before God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øpot, thou ≈øhalt be ≈øtedfa≈øt, and ≈øhalt not fear.</hi> A ≈øtrange expre≈ø≈øion, That if you will keep ≈øin far away, then you ≈øhall be ≈øtedfa≈øt before God, and not fear; that is, you ≈øhall not be expo≈øed to tho≈øe fears and doubts and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which other men are expo≈øed to. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near to God with an upright heart, in fall a≈ø≈øurance of faith.</hi> Now what ≈øhall a man do to come to God in full a≈ø≈øurance? Mark the next words, <hi>Draw nigh to God in full a≈ø≈øurance of faith, having your hearts ≈øprinkled from an evill con≈øcience.</hi> Here is the way, if you are ≈øprinkled from an evill con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, you may be bold to come to God in full a≈ø≈øurance. Whereas, alas, if thy con≈øcience tell thee, thou art a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma≈øter, and thou art a deceiver, and a liar, and loo≈øe liver, thou can≈øt not come with full a≈ø≈øurance; thou maye≈øt come in pre≈øumption indeed, but not with the a≈ø≈øurance of faith: and therefore keep a con≈øcience clear from harbouring guilt upon it, and that's the way to have the heart ≈øull of joy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, be diligent in keeping company with the mo≈øt godly experienced Chri≈øtians where you live, this is a very ≈øpecial way to increa≈øe your comforts. Ye read an excellent pa≈ø≈øage, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.4. <hi>We are comforted of God,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>that we might comfort others with the comfort wherewith we are comforted of God.</hi> Godly Chri≈øtians they will comfort you with the ≈øame comforts wherewith they them≈øelves are comforted. <hi>If we are comforted, it is for your con≈øolation.</hi> Godly men if they have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115140:67"/>comfort from God, they will impart their experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to you, and tell you as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>What God hath done for their ≈øoul.</hi> There is no way better then this, to keep in communion with godly and knowing Chri≈øtians. Ma≈øter <hi>Bradford</hi> that famous Martyr who was in pri≈øon about his profe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt, the ≈øtory ≈øaith he lay a long time under trouble of minde, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of con≈øcience, that he could not finde a real and clear evidence of his effectual calling: there came many men to him, and could not ≈øettle him. Yet a poore Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, an ancient and experienced Chri≈øtian, that did u≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accompany Ma≈øter <hi>Bradford</hi> in pri≈øon, by his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent communion with this poore man, he got more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort then ever he got all his life before. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, this I ≈øpeak to you to make you the more to ≈øtudy the worth of godly ≈øociety, and the more you are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant with Chri≈øtians that live in the enjoyment of the light of Gods countenance, and in the a≈ø≈øurance of his favour all the day long, the more you are in the ready way to increa≈øe your comforts and a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Submit thy ≈øelf to the approbation of others, and be willing to have them pa≈øs a verdict upon thee. When thou art a ≈øleep or in a ≈øwoun, then thou can≈øt not tel thy≈øelf what thou do≈øt, but others mu≈øt tell thee; So it may fall out with the godly; they may be in ≈øuch a ≈øpiritual ≈øwoun that the yare not fit judges of their own condition; in this ca≈øe ≈øubmit to the judgement of others, they may ≈øee grace in thee when thou thy ≈øelf can≈øt not ≈øee it; ≈øo Ma≈øter <hi>Throgmorton</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by the Te≈øtimony of a company of godly Mini≈øters.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Live in the daily improvement of grace, and that's the way to get a≈ø≈øurance. And this meanes the holy Gho≈øt layes down in the Chapter, out of which my text is taken, <hi>Adde grace to grace.</hi> And I remember that <hi>Beza</hi> upon this text doth write, that in the Greek Tran≈ølations, the≈øe words are put in, <hi>Give diligence by good works to make your calling ≈øure:</hi> whether it be ≈øo or no, I cannot affirm, but this I am ≈øure of, and the context will clearly prove it,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115140:67"/>that the way to make your calling ≈øure, is to adde grace to grace. For after the Apo≈øtle had ≈øpoken of adding grace to grace, he comes in with this, <hi>Give diligence to make your calling ≈øure:</hi> Implying, that the more you live in the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of grace, the more you ≈øhall live in the enjoyment of comforts. <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>The works of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe ≈øhall be peace.</hi> Not the habit, but the work; if you act righteou≈øne≈øs, and live in the workings and thrivings in grace, this ≈øhall be peace, and the effect of it quietne≈ø≈øe and a≈ø≈øurance for ever. So <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>The more you pray, the more you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe your joy.</hi> So that the more you live in the improvement of grace, the more likely way you are into get a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If you would get a≈ø≈øurance, ≈øpend more time in ≈øtrengthening your evidences for heaven, then in que≈øtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. It is the great fault of many Chri≈øtians, they will ≈øpend much time in que≈øtioning and not in ≈øtrengthening their comforts. They will rea≈øon them≈øelves into unbeliefe, and ≈øay, Lord, why ≈øhould I believe? why ≈øhould I take hold of a promi≈øe? that am ≈øo unholy and ≈øo unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a creature? And ≈øo by this they rea≈øon them≈øelves to ≈øuch a pa≈ø≈øe, that they dare not lay hold upon Chri≈øt; whereas it ≈øhould be your work to rea≈øon your ≈øelves into Chri≈øt as much as you can. Labour to ≈øtrengthen your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; and rea≈øon thus, Why ≈øhould I not believe in Chri≈øt? Thus <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 42. <hi>Why art thou troubled O my ≈øoul, and why art thou ca≈øt down within me.</hi> Is not the mercy of God more then ≈øin in the creature? Is not there free grace, where there is guilt. Are not there pardoning mercies, where condemnation is de≈øerved? you ≈øhould rea≈øon up your comforts rather then rea≈øon them down; and ≈øpend more time in ≈øtrengthening? then in que≈øtioning of them. You would count him a very unwi≈øe man, that hath a Lea≈øe of ≈øo much land, and he him≈øelfe ≈øhall create ≈øcruples and doubts, and ≈øhall u≈øe no means to make his title good: And truly many Chri≈øtians are as unwi≈øe for heaven; They have, as I may ≈øay, good bond and ≈øeal that God will bring them to heaven, and yet they will que≈øtion,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115140:68"/>and cavill them≈øelves into unbeliefe. Beloved, this ≈øhould not be, but you ought rather to ≈øtrengthen your comforts, then que≈øtion them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Be diligent in the earne≈øt ≈øtudy of the Covenant of grace: Beloved, all a Chri≈øtians doubts ari≈øe from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Covenant of grace. And here that I may ≈øpeak a little to it, I be≈øeech you follow me, ≈øtudy the Covenant of grace; which if you do, you ≈øhall di≈øcern five particular props in it to bear up your hearts again≈øt di≈øcomforts, and to ≈øtrengthen you in a way of a≈ø≈øurance touching your ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual call.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, the Covenant of works it commands perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience upon pain of damnation; but the Covenant of grace doth command and accept of imperfect obedience, if it be ≈øincere: there's your fir≈øt prop.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Covenant of works is not contented with good de≈øires, unle≈ø≈øe there be good deeds; the Covenant of grace accepts the good will and good de≈øires, when the deed is wanting, and is content with the will for the deed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Covenant of works doth require that you ≈øhould obey the will of God perfectly in your own per≈øon; the Covenant of grace requires onely that you obey in the per≈øon of Chri≈øt; ≈øo Chri≈øt obeyes for you, it is accepted, though you do not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Covenant of works requires you to obey the whole will of God by your own ≈øtrength; the Covenant of grace accepts of it, though not our own ≈øtrength, but the ≈øtrength of Chri≈øt be put forth in doing any ≈øpiritual action.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Covenant of works requires the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the condition, before it gives the Promi≈øe; As, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> you cannot live, ≈øaith the Covenant of works, without you do this: but the Covenant of grace, it fir≈øt tenders the Promi≈øe, and then requires the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Bids you fir≈øt take Chri≈øt, and fir≈øt Believe, and then ≈øhew forth the effects of faith. Fir≈øt, lay hold upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, and then hold forth and practi≈øe the condition of that Promi≈øe. Fir≈øt believe, and fir≈øt take Chri≈øt, though
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115140:68"/>thou art unworthy, and art a wretched creature, if after taking of him thou wilt be con≈øciencious to practi≈øe tho≈øe obligations this lies upon thee, and I will accept thee. Now would you lay the≈øe to your heart, to ≈øtudy that va≈øt difference between the Covenant of works and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, doubtle≈ø≈øe the≈øe would be great props for your inward comforts.</p>

               <p>Fir≈øt, After the Lord hath greatly humbled the hearts of his people, and broken them for ≈øinne, then doth he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115140:69"/>u≈øually give in mo≈øt a≈ø≈øurance of a mans effectual calling, and of the happine≈ø≈øe of his future condition.

Nigh, what to do? not onely to give them deliverance from outward troubles, but from inward ≈øorrows; to give them inward joy, and inward comforts, <hi>that the bones which he hath broken might rejoyce.</hi> The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken ≈øpirit, to give them comfort. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. It's ≈øaid there, that <hi>the Spirit of the Lord was upon Chri≈øt,</hi> what to do? It was <hi>to binde up the broken in heart, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort tho≈øe that mourn.</hi> So <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 61.1.2, 3. <hi>To tho≈øe that mourn, he ≈øhould preach comfort, and binde up the broken-hearted.</hi> When the Lord hath broken you under ≈øinne, and humbled you under the ≈øight of your evils, then is the time when God will break in upon you with greate≈øt joy. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all you that are weary, and heavy laden, and I will give you re≈øt;</hi> Re≈øt there, hath not onely reference to our re≈øt in heaven, that we ≈øhall re≈øt there from ≈øinne, and re≈øt there from ≈øorrow, and re≈øt there from temptation, but <hi>I will give you re≈øt;</hi> it hath reference al≈øo to a promi≈øe in this life, that if you are heavy laden, that you count your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities a burden too heavy for you to bear, Chri≈øt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed you peace, inward peace in your own con≈øciences, in the a≈ø≈øurance of your everla≈øting e≈øtate, in a≈ø≈øurance that you are called to a ≈øtate of grace, and ≈øhall come to a ≈øtate of glory. You know when the ground is plowed, the clods
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115140:70"/>are broken, and the breaking of the clods makes way for the deeper rooting of the corn, and that it may ≈øpring up with greater increa≈øe. It is ≈øo when ye <hi>plow up,</hi> in the Prophets Language, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. <hi>the fallow ground of your hearts;</hi> when you break the clods of your hearts by humiliation, this makes way for the corn and grain, that precious grain of a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance to ≈øpring and grow up to a fuller mea≈øure; ≈øo that you are out of Gods way then to have ≈øtrong a≈ø≈øurance, that never have been humbled in the ≈øight of ≈øinne. I ≈øay, it's Gods ordinary way. I do not deny but God may bring you to heaven, though you have no legal workings and horrors upon you; yet God will never give you ≈øuch ≈øtrong a≈ø≈øurance, and ≈øuch ravi≈øhing comforts, as he gives them that are mo≈øt broken in ≈øpirit. Look through the whole verge of Scripture, and you ≈øhall finde that tho≈øe that were mo≈øt broken in heart, they were mo≈øt ≈øtrong in comfort. That hou≈øe that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>th the deepe≈øt foundation, is likely to be the mo≈øt beautiful Fabrick and building; whereas your tents and le≈ø≈øer cottages, a little rooting in the earth will ≈øerve their turn: It is likely God may make thee as a little cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, though not deeply rooted; but thou wilt never be reared up a beautiful building, to become an amiable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian in point of comfort and a≈ø≈øurance, if God have not bottomed thee low in humiliation. It's a true rule in grace, <hi>They that ≈øow in tears, ≈øhall reap in joy.</hi> The deeper you are in ≈øorrow, the higher you ≈øhall be lifted up in joy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after the people of God have been to≈ø≈øed and tumbled, and turmoiled with the violent a≈ø≈øaults and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of the devil, then is Gods time of filling his people with greate≈øt joy and mo≈øt comfort. You know at the Mill, at the Floodgate, when the ≈øtream goes ≈øtronge≈øt, then the Mill goes fa≈øte≈øt. Beloved, God lets the ≈øtream of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation grow ≈øtrong again≈øt thee, but to make thy Mill to go, to make thee grinde thy lu≈øts to powder, and to make thee grinde thy ≈øinnes as corn under the Mill≈øtone. God doth but make the flood to be ≈øtrong at the gate, to make thy comforts to be more ≈øtrong, and thy graces to be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115140:70"/>more firm. When God lets in a flood of temptation, and to≈ø≈øeth thee upon tho≈øe waves and billows, then is the time for God to give thee in ≈øtronge≈øt comforts. <hi>E≈øa</hi> 54.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>O thou afflicted, to≈ø≈øed with Tempe≈øt, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</hi> Mark their e≈øtate. Now what will God do with a ≈øoul thus to≈ø≈øed with a Temptation? Read the ver≈øe before, <hi>My Covenant of peace ≈øhall not depart from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>, O thou afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> God doth here ≈øpeak mo≈øt peace, and tenders mo≈øt freely his Covenant in this condition, when they were mo≈øt to≈ø≈øed and tumbled. And ver≈øe 13. <hi>Thy children ≈øhall be all taught of God, and great ≈øhall be their peace.</hi> And ver≈øe 14. <hi>In righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe thou ≈øhall be e≈øtabli≈øhed, and thou ≈øhalt not fear.</hi> Here you ≈øee how God as it were boul≈øters and beares up a dejected heart; <hi>O thou to≈ø≈øed with a Tempe≈øt, Behold, I have made a Covenant of peace with thee,</hi> and <hi>Behold, thy children ≈øhall have peace,</hi> and <hi>Behold, thou ≈øhalt not fear.</hi> See how God keeps up the hearts of his people in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; when you are mo≈øt to≈ø≈øed and tumbled with the tempe≈øt of temptation, then doth God ordinarily ≈øpeak to you mo≈øt inward peace and ≈øtronge≈øt a≈ø≈øurance. As you know it is with an Oake, the more they are ≈øhaken by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe≈øtuous windes, the firmer and fa≈øter are they rooted in the bowels of the earth: It is ≈øo with Chri≈øtians; they are compared in Scripture to an Oak, who≈øe fruit and ≈øap is in them: Now a Chri≈øtian, the more he is ≈øhaken by a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtuous temptation, the Lord makes him by that to be the more firm, and to be the more fa≈øtened and ≈øetled in ≈øtrong comforts and a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when God hath any extraordinary work for his people, either to do or ≈øuffer, this is a time when he fills his people with mo≈øt a≈ø≈øurance. Should God put his people upon outward ≈øufferings, and give them inward fears, they were not in a capacity to undergo the condition with joy or patience: and therefore when he calls his people to ≈øome extraordinary mea≈øure of ≈øuffering, this is the time when God will fill them with more then ordinary comforts I have read in the book of Martyrs of Mr <hi>Robert Glover,</hi> a famous
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115140:71"/>man in his generation, who during the time of his impri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was much troubled in minde for want of his a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet the ≈øtory tells us, when he was brought to the ≈øtake to be burnt, a≈ø≈øoon as ever he ≈øaw the fire, he broke out in the hearing of the people, and ≈øaid, He is come, he is come; I am now as full of joy as my heart can hold. All the while he was in pri≈øon, he was blubbring and much troubled, till God brought him to an eminent ≈øuffering, to ≈øuffer death for him, and then he was full of comfort. I have read al≈øo of one <hi>Adolphus Clarebachius,</hi> who was a man ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Melancholy, and lay under many doubts and fears, yet a≈ø≈øoon as ever he was brought to the ≈øtake, he openly declared to the people, I have been naturally of a ≈øad Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but now I profe≈ø≈øe before you all, I think there is not a merrier heart in all the world then mine is. Thus they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go through extraordinary ≈øufferings, God gave them extraordinary a≈ø≈øurance. Beloved, this is Gods time, when he will give you mo≈øt a≈ø≈øurance, when he calls you to mo≈øt ≈øufferings. When you are to go through an Ocean of ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and afflictions, the Lord will make you ≈øwim in a Sea of inward peace and ≈øpiritual joyes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God gives his people mo≈øt ≈øtrong a≈ø≈øurance, when they walk mo≈øt clo≈øely in communion with their God. <hi>Great peace ≈øhall they have,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>David, that love thy law;</hi> they ≈øhall have peace, and great peace, while they walk in love to God and his wayes. Keep in communion with your God, and that's the time for God to give you in greate≈øt comfort; If ye la≈øh out from God and break his law, he will break your hearts. When the ≈øhepheard hath a Lamb, or a Sheep, that ≈øtraggles from the fold, it ≈øhall meet with a Crook, happily with the bite of a dog. It may be God may catch you with his hook, happily you ≈øhall be bitten with a Temptation, and bitten with de≈øertion, if you ≈øtraggle from his fold; but the more you keep in communion with God, the more likely you are to keep in your comforts; walking with God is the very fewel that kindles the fire of comfort in a Chri≈øtians bre≈øt, that keeps comfort alive. The more
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115140:71"/>you flag in your communion, the more ≈øhall you flag in your a≈ø≈øurance, and the more ≈øhall your comforts die. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with your God, it hath two particulars in it. Fir≈øt, in keeping you free from ≈øinne, <hi>Job</hi> 11.14, 15. Secondly, in keeping in the exerci≈øe of grace, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 32.17. Now, the more you keep out ≈øinne, the more you keep in comforts; the more you increa≈øe in grace, the more you increa≈øe in comforts. Grace and comfort, they one promote another; Grace promotes comfort, and comfort heightens you in the increa≈øe of grace: Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> in his ≈øalutations puts them both together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. And thus having fini≈øhed this Query, there is onely one more, which (God willing) I ≈øhall di≈øpatch at this time; And that is</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Wherein appeares the difference between that man that hath a≈ø≈øurance of his effectual calling upon good ground, and between tho≈øe men that onely have pre≈øumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous per≈øwa≈øions of their effectual calling, when they are not? Beloved, this que≈øtion is worthy the di≈øcu≈ø≈øion; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolve it, I ≈øhall lay down 9 or 10 differences; As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, That man that hath ≈øound and true a≈ø≈øurance of his effectual calling, he is very careful to take heed of ≈øinne, that ≈øo he might not eclip≈øe his comforts, or lo≈øe his a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. He is careful (I ≈øay) to free his heart from ≈øin as much as may be, as con≈øidering, that though he cannot ≈øinne away his ≈øoule, he may ≈øinne away his comforts; though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ≈øinne away his ≈øalvation, he may ≈øinne away his con≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. A man that hath this a≈ø≈øurance, he knowes the worth of a≈ø≈øurance, and he knowes how ≈øoon it is lo≈øt, and how hardly it is gained; and that makes him very tender of ≈øin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having the≈øe Promi≈øes, let us clean≈øe our ≈øelves.</hi> When a godly man knowes that God is his God, (For that's the Promi≈øe ≈øpoken of in the ver≈øe before) knowing that he belongs to God, and the Promi≈øes belong to him; he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, it makes him clean≈øe him≈øelfe from all filthine≈ø≈øe, both of fle≈øh and ≈øpirit; that he keep no ≈øinne in the ≈øpirit, nor no ≈øin in the body. A man that hath a≈ø≈øurance, it makes him very tender of every ≈øinne: But now, a man that hath
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115140:72"/>pre≈øumptuous per≈øwa≈øions of his own goodne≈ø≈øe, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øions will make him more bold, and more venturo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>kedne≈ø≈øe day after day; he is bold and venturous upon every ≈øin. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.4.5. <hi>Thou ha≈øt cried to me, My Father, my Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>r, thou art the guide of my youth; with thou re≈øerve anger for ever, and ≈øhall there be no end of thy indignation?</hi> Yet what ≈øaith God? <hi>Yet thou did≈øt evill as much as thou could≈øt.</hi> As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, You cry, My Father; you per≈øwade your ≈øelves God is your Father, and yet you will ≈øpeak and do evil as much as you can: Here God brands them for a pre≈øumptuous people. To per≈øwade your ≈øelves that God is your Father, and yet to do wickedne≈ø≈øe as much as you can, and to be drunk as often as you can, and ≈øwear as oft as you can; alas you deceive your own hearts in this: for God cannot be your Father in this ≈øen≈øe. And Beloved, I be≈øeech you in my going over the≈øe heads, that you would lay them to your own hearts, and ≈øee if you may be di≈øtingui≈øhed from tho≈øe pre≈øumptuous per≈øwa≈øions, that goe over the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a man that hath reall a≈ø≈øurance of his effectual calling, that man meets with more a≈ø≈øaults and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the devil to annoy him in his peace, then other men do that have only a counterfeit a≈ø≈øurance. As you know tho≈øe ≈øhops that have the be≈øt wares, and riche≈øt Trea≈øures, Gold-≈ømiths ≈øhops, they are mo≈øt expo≈øed to Robbery; when men will not meddle with a petty ≈øtall. Tho≈øe ≈øhips that are mo≈øt richly laden, they are in mo≈øt danger to meet with Pirats at ≈øea, when your ≈ømaller barks laden with goods of le≈ø≈øer value ≈øcape-free: It is ≈øo with Chri≈øtians. Tho≈øe Chri≈øtians, that are mo≈øt richly laden with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of a≈ø≈øurance, that have in their hearts this precious jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, they are in mo≈øt danger of the devils Temptations, to be as a Pirat or Robber, by force to ≈øet upon them, to annoy them. It is tho≈øe that have mo≈øt a≈ø≈øurance, that the devil doth envy mo≈øt, that he will never let them alone, but hunts
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115140:72"/>them as a Partridge over the Mountaines by dejections, and by ≈øugge≈øtions, and by variety of Temptations, Satans fierie≈øt darts; and by di≈øtru≈øt, and by injected ≈øcruples, and by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of carnal rea≈øonings, and by con≈øulting with fle≈øh and blood, and for want of comfortable feelings; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will be ≈øtill putting them on, to ≈øee if he can damp their comforts, and make them <hi>ca≈øt away their confidence, which hath a great recompence of reward.</hi> Hence it is the Apo≈øtle pre≈ø≈øeth that Chri≈øtians ≈øhould not ca≈øt away their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, (a Metaphor ≈øome think drawn from a ≈øhip at Sea;
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.35.</note> Merchants, when they are at Sea, when their ≈øhip by a ≈øtorm and tempe≈øt is to≈øt upon the billows, and likely to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ≈øhipwrack, being heavy laden, they will ca≈øt away their wares, to ≈øave their lives. Now ≈øome, in Allu≈øion to this, think that the devil ≈øo to≈ø≈øeth a poor ≈øoul in point of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as a ≈øhip is to≈ø≈øed upon the Sea by the winde. Now if you are to≈ø≈øed upon the Sea of Temptation, and upon the waves of Trouble and A≈ø≈øaults, do not ca≈øt away your wares, do not throw away your comforts,) which implies, that godly men are often ≈øet upon, and often a≈ø≈øaulted; that though the devil cannot bring you to hell, he would fain have you to have a hell in your con≈øciences while you live; he doth not only envy your happine≈ø≈øe, but comforts al≈øo: Whereas on the contrary, men that harbour per≈øwa≈øions they are called, when they are not; the devil Iulls them a≈øleep, he lets them alone, and never troubles them. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. <hi>When the strong man po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth the hou≈øe, the goods are at peace:</hi> That is, when the devil of hell hath whole po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ≈øoul of a man, he is no whit tempted, his thoughts are at quiet. When the devil ≈øees a man build upon a ≈øandy and corrupt foundation, he will never ≈øhake that by a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation le≈øt you ≈øhould by ≈øhaking be a wakened to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>a better and more induring ≈øub≈øtance.</hi> When the devil ≈øees you Iull'd a≈øleep in a golden dream of pre≈øumption, he will never awaken you by Temptation, but I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts you ≈øleep on, becau≈øe he knowes that ≈øleep will be a ≈øleep to death. As a man lying a≈øleep on a ≈øteep rock, dreams merrily of Crowns
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115140:73"/>and Kingdoms, but ≈øuddenly ≈øtarting for joy, breake his neck, and tumbles into the bottom of the Sea; ≈øo is it with a man that harbours ungrounded per≈øwa≈øions of his good e≈øtate. That which a carnal man makes his evidence, that he is in a good condition, is an undoubted demon≈øtration he is in a bad. You ≈øhall have a wicked man, when he hears a godly man to be troubled in minde and wounded in ≈øpirit, he will tell you, he thanks God, he was never troubled ≈øince he was born, the devil never di≈øturbed him, and he hath had a ≈øtrong faith ever ≈øince he can remember. Alas, Beloved, this is a ≈øad ≈øigne; thou make≈øt this a ≈øign of thy comfort, whereas indeed it is a demon≈øtration of thy want of a ≈øound a≈ø≈øurance; for were thy a≈ø≈øurance good, the Devil would never let thee alone, but would ≈øtill be labouring to make thee ca≈øt away thy confidence; but being bad, he would have thee nouri≈øh it ≈øtill. We ≈øay, tho≈øe Oxen that are fed in greene≈øt pa≈øtures, they are neare≈øt the ≈ølaughter; when the poor lean Oxe that hath the yoke and whip every day, and is at daily labour, is long liv'd, and in a better condition. Tho≈øe men that the devill lets alone, and never tempts, that are as fatted oxen, never come under the whip and yoke, and never are troubled; it is an argument, they are near the ≈ølaughter, and under a great deal of danger of their ≈øouls: but tho≈øe that are under the yoke, that are often tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the pricks of Sathan lie upon them; this is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, their comforts are right, and their evidence good, becau≈øe ≈øo a≈ø≈øaulted and oppo≈øed by the devil.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, true a≈ø≈øurance is more or le≈ø≈øe in a mans ≈øpirit, by how much more or le≈ø≈øe that man keeps in communion with God. If a man doth rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t in his conver≈øe with God, and grow carele≈ø≈øe and formal, and a ≈øtranger to God, he ≈øhall grow a ≈øtranger to him≈øelfe in the end, and to his comforts al≈øo: but if a man keep clo≈øe to God, and keep clo≈øe to duties, can retire and recollect him≈øelf to conver≈øe with God in a more ≈øolemn and ≈øerious manner, is preparedly and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exerci≈øed in Ordinances, can poure out his ≈øoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods bo≈øome; that man is in the way to have his comforts
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115140:73"/>rai≈øed up. Whereas now for men that have fal≈øe comforts and per≈øwa≈øions, whether they are much or little with God, all is one to them, their comforts are at the ≈øame ≈øtand ≈øtill. Come to a man that hath fal≈øe comforts, and at all times he is alike peremptory, he is in the ≈øame per≈øwa≈øion he was 3.4.7. yeares ago. Ask him any week in the yeer, any day in the week, any hour in the day, and he will tell you, he hath the ≈øame comforts, and the ≈øame evidences ≈øtill: he had a ≈øtrong faith in God, and he hath it ≈øtill; he had ≈øtrong hopes to be ≈øaved, and ≈øo he hath ≈øtill; he is ≈øtill pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory in his comforts, though he never ≈øo much alter in communion with his God: this is an argument thy per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions are ≈øal≈øe, becau≈øe a Chri≈øtians communion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe with God doth feed his comforts. Now as the body, by how the much more or le≈ø≈øe it is fed, by ≈øo much the more it is weakened or ≈øtrengthened: ≈øo it is with your comforts; ≈øo much as they are cheri≈øhed by your walking with God, ≈øo much they grow weak or ≈øtrong. Now let a wicked man grow never ≈øo vile, and never ≈øo ≈øinful, it interrupts not his peace; he hath hopes and a≈ø≈øurance ≈øtill, and he will tru≈øt in God ≈øtill, though he ≈øin ever; this is an argument, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are un≈øound. You have a lively picture of this, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.11. <hi>The heads of the people judge forreward, the Prie≈øts teach for hire, and the Prophets divine for mony: and yet they will lean upon the Lord; and ≈øay, Is not the Lord among us?</hi> That is, though they have the≈øe ≈øins among them, and did walk thus and thus; yet they would hope in God to be ≈øaved for all this. Why, Beloved, thou wilt find God to fail thee; though he never faild an a≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtian, yet he will fail that man that leanes upon him, when he belongs not to him. When thou do≈øt intermit walking with God, and do≈øt lanch forth into a gulph and ≈øea of lu≈øts, and yet can≈øt ≈øtill ≈øay, thou art the ≈øame in thy comforts, and the ≈øame in thy per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions; it is an argument all thy comforts are but fal≈øe, and thy evidence un≈øound.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Reall a≈ø≈øurance of your e≈øtate, it doth bear up the ≈øoul under the greate≈øt outward ≈øorrow and ≈øufferings
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115140:74"/>that it can meet with in this world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>They ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered joyfully the ≈øpoiling of their goods, knowing in them≈øelves that they had in heaven a better and more induring ≈øub≈øtance.</hi> What made them ≈øo to rejoyce to ≈øee their hou≈øes plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before them, their e≈øtates taken from them, but this, they knew in their own ≈øelves, and had a≈ø≈øurance in their own hearts that Chri≈øt was theirs, and heaven was theirs? and this made them ≈øuffer joyfully the ≈øpoiling of their goods. So <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.50. <hi>This is my comfort in affliction, that thy word doth quicken me;</hi> That is, this beares up my heart, when I am afflicted, that I have a Word to build upon, that I have a≈ø≈øurance, I have intere≈øt in a Promi≈øe to build upon; this quickens and bears me up under my ≈øorrowes.

<note place="margin">The ≈øen≈øe of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of their ≈øin ≈øhall take away the ≈øen≈øe of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> So <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 33.24. <hi>The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant ≈øhall not ≈øay, I am ≈øick; the people that dwell therein, ≈øhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> Beloved, A≈ø≈øurance will lift up and bear up the heart under all ≈øorrows. A≈ø≈øurance in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian is like oile. Now poure oile into a ≈øea or ocean of water, and the oile will never be kept under, but ≈øtill be uppermo≈øt; ≈øo this oile of comfort, and this oile of a≈ø≈øurance, it will bear thee up on the top, though thou ≈øhould≈øt be ca≈øt into a flood of troubles, and an ocean of ≈øorrowes. I have read in <hi>Latimers</hi> witings a notable ≈øaying of his to <hi>Ridley</hi> that famous Marty. Sometime, ≈øaith he, when I live in a ≈øetled and ≈øtedfa≈øt a≈ø≈øurance about the ≈øtate of my ≈øoul, me thinks then I am as bold as a Lion, I can laugh at all trouble, no affliction daunts me; but when I am eclip≈øed in my comforts, I am of ≈øo fearfu a ≈øpirit, that I could run into a very mou≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole. Beloved, it is ≈øo with godly men, when they want a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance of their e≈øtate, and the ≈øoundne≈ø≈øe of their call, every affliction daunts, and every trouble ≈øtartles them. O but when they can live in a ≈øetled a≈ø≈øurance of their intere≈øt in Chri≈øt, and calling by him; they are as bold as Lions, and they are born up with comfort, under all the ≈øorrowes and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115140:74"/>≈øufferings they meet withall. But now men that have fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øions, their per≈øwa≈øions can never bear up the heart under a trouble, and at a lo≈ø≈øe, and at a pinch; becau≈øe it is not a ≈øaving and inward comfort, it can never create inward peace. The comforts of wicked men when they come to ≈øuffer, they are like cloth that is ill woven. Cloth that is well made, let a man be in a ≈øhowre of rain, it will never ≈øhrink; but ill woven cloth, let it be but in a ≈øhowre, it ≈øhrinkes pre≈øently: It is ≈øo with mens comforts; Bring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts well wrought into a ≈øhowre of trouble, and that man will not ≈øhrink under his trouble; but bring an ill wrought and un≈øound a≈ø≈øurance, and that will ≈øhrink and fail, and pull in, and will not bear up the heart under the ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and ≈øufferings he may meet withall. Pre≈øuming <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton,</hi> that boa≈øted his fat fle≈øh ≈øhould fry in the fire before he would for≈øake his Religion; when he came to the trial, flagged pre≈øently.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Sound a≈ø≈øurance, whereever it is, it makes the heart more humble towards God and man, and more vile in its own eyes. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. There you have this Character: <hi>I live,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Paul, by the faith of the Sonne of God; and Chri≈øt hath loved me, and given him≈øelfe for me.</hi> Here is his a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: what then? Doth this lift up <hi>Paul?</hi> NO, it makes him marvel; <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chri≈øt liveth in me; Paul</hi> recollects him≈øelf, I live, no; it is not I that live, but Chri≈øt that liveth in me. See how <hi>Paul</hi> was beaten off from a ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious pride and exaltation of ≈øpirit in him≈øelfe. It is not I that live. The thoughts of his comforts made him recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect him≈øelfe, and ≈øeeme vile in his own eyes: Whereas (alas) fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øions puffe up the ≈øoule with pride, and make a man ≈øupercilious, and high conceited, crying out as <hi>Jehu</hi> did, <hi>Jonadab, is thy heart like mine? Come ≈øee my zeal for the Lord;</hi> they make him proud like <hi>Jehu</hi> in his fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øions.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Sound comforts, and real a≈ø≈øurance do engage the ≈øoul to walk before God in a cour≈øe of holine≈ø≈øe, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Thy loving kindne≈ø≈øe is before mine eyes;</hi> that is, I am
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115140:75"/>a≈ø≈øured, as if I ≈øaw the thing with mine eye, that Gods loving kindne≈ø≈øe is towards me. What then? <hi>and I will walk in thy truth.</hi> I will walk before thee with a holy and ≈øincere heart; and <hi>I will not haunt with vain per≈øons,</hi> ver≈øe 4. And <hi>I will wa≈øh my hands in innocency,</hi> ver≈øe 6, &amp;c. ≈øo that you ≈øee <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> would walk in a cour≈øe of holine≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe he had an evidence, and a≈ø≈øurance of Gods love to him So 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>He that hath this hope in him, purifieth him≈øelf, even as Chri≈øt is pure;</hi> that is, that man that doth nouri≈øh hopes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øions of heaven, his hopes will make him a Chri≈øtian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring to purifie his own heart, and to be holy as Chri≈øt is holy. This is the nature of true a≈ø≈øurance. But now for fal≈øe a≈ø≈øurance, the man that hath it, doth not look after holine≈ø≈øe at all; he thinks him≈øelfe well enough, that he hath attained that which every wi≈øe man ≈øhould re≈øt in,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Si dixeris ≈øufficit peru≈øti. Aug. de verb. Apo≈øt. Serm.</hi> 18.</note> without medling any further; nay, he is ≈øo far from laying bonds upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe to walk in a cour≈øe of holine≈ø≈øe, that he will rather take incouragement from thence to walk in a way of loo≈øene≈ø≈øe and profanene≈ø≈øe: Becau≈øe grace abounds, he will abound in ≈øin; this is the ill u≈øe that fal≈øe comfort makes of Gods grace. And therefore, Beloved, look over your hearts. Do the comforts you pretend to have, and the a≈ø≈øurance you pretend to enjoy, make you more to pur≈øue holine≈ø≈øe? that you can ≈øay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I ≈øee thy loving kindne≈ø≈øe is before me,</hi> and therefore <hi>I will love thy wayes, and hate ≈øinfulne≈ø≈øe;</hi> or can you ≈øay, you have comforts, therefore you will run into ≈øin, and wallow in wickednes? this is an argument thy comforts are not true.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, True a≈ø≈øurance, it is got and kept with a great deal of diligence and indu≈øtry. Your be≈øt things are harde≈øt to get, and harde≈øt to keep. Stones are to be had in every place; but gold, you mu≈øt dig deep, and take paines to dive into the bowels of the earth, before you can get that. Weeds grow ea≈øily, but your fine garden-flowers, they mu≈øt be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en watered, and carefully looked unto, or el≈øe they will not grow: Beloved, this weed of fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øion and a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it is a weed that will grow under every hedge, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115140:75"/>thrive in every Garden without looking after; whereas alas, the flower of true comforts and ≈øaving a≈ø≈øurance, it is hard to make it grow; and when it is growne, it is hard to keep it from withering and bla≈øting. A≈ø≈øurance it co≈øts a man the waiting many a year, the ≈øhedding many a teare, the making of many a prayer, before he can get or keep it; whereas alas, fal≈øe a≈ø≈øurance it is ea≈øily gotten, and ea≈øily kept. A man may get pre≈øumption without any paines at all; the devil will egge you on both to get and keep it: Therefore you that ea≈øily get your comforts without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and keep your comforts without paines, you may be ≈øure your comforts are but fal≈øe.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, True a≈ø≈øurance it is got by the Word, and grounded upon the Word. It is got by the Word, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 57.19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace, to them that are nigh, and to them that are afarre of.</hi> The fruit of the Lips, that is, the fruit of the Mini≈øters preaching; the Word which falls from the Lips of a godly Mini≈øter: God hath ordained and created that to be the way to work and create peace, peace; that is a ≈øound peace in the hearts of his people. And it is not onely got, but it is bottomed upon the Word al≈øo. It is the Word and ≈øomewhat in the Word, that beares up the hearts of the people of God, <hi>P≈øal,</hi> 119.49. <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord, wherein thou ha≈øt cau≈øed thy ≈øervant to hope.</hi> So ver≈øe 50, 51. It is the Word of God that bottomes the comforts of the people of God; whereas look now upon wicked men, and they neither got their comfors by the Word, nor do they ground them upon the Word; but fir≈øt, they have had ≈øtrong hopes in God ever ≈øince they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; and ≈øecondly, they keep and ground them either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their good meaning, that they mean well towards God, or el≈øe thirdly, they ground them upon this, that they are not ≈øo bad as other men are. A poor weak ground. The Phari≈øee could ≈øay ≈øo; <hi>I am no extortioner, no drunkard, no adulterer, and the like:</hi> yet never came to heaven for all this. Or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>≈øe fourthly, they ground their comforts on this, becau≈øe they receive from God abundance of outward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>. And this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115140:76"/>you finde was their ground of pre≈øumption, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Ephraim ≈øaid, I am become rich, and I have found me out ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance; in all my labour they ≈øhall finde no iniquity in me, that is, ≈øinne. Ephraim</hi> would ≈øay, I am become rich, and have got me an e≈øtate, and now I am an hone≈øt man, and they ≈øhall finde no ≈øinne in me: yet this was a meer pre≈øumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becau≈øe God tells us, <hi>Eccle≈ø.</hi> 9.1. <hi>No man knowes either love or hatred by the things that are before him.</hi> And <hi>≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Solomon, God gives men riches to their hurt;</hi> And therefore this can be no evidence of a grounded a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, That man that hath a good a≈ø≈øurance, he is willing to be tried either by God or man, touching the truth of his a≈ø≈øurance. This you finde, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 26.2, 3. <hi>Try me, O Lord, examine me, prove me, and try my reines, and my heart, for thy loving kindene≈ø≈øe is before me.</hi> As if he ≈øhould ≈øay. Lord, I make a profe≈ø≈øion, that I have thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe in mine eye, that I am a≈ø≈øured thou love≈øt me; Lord, I put my ≈øoul upon the Trial: Do thou try me, if my heart be not right in my a≈ø≈øurance. And not by God onely, but they are willing to be tried by man al≈øo. And therefore you have that phra≈øe of the Apo≈øtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. that <hi>when men ask you an account of the hope that is in you, you ≈øhould be ready to give an≈øwer;</hi> that is, when men ask you what hopes you have of heaven, and upon what ground do you hope to be ≈øaved? the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, you ≈øhould be ready to give an≈øwer of that hope that is in you. And who were they that ≈øhould do ≈øo? they were tho≈øe that <hi>had a good con≈øcience,</hi> tho≈øe men that had con≈øciences free from ≈øin, and had evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their own con≈øciences, that they belonged to God, they were ready, whoever asked them, to give a rea≈øon why they hoped for heaven. Whereas a man that hath fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øions of heaven and of his effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that man cannot endure to be tried either by God or man. He is like the man that hath ≈øtolne goods in his hou≈øe. A man that is an hone≈øt man, let the Con≈øtable come, let ≈øearch be made, it never troubles him, becau≈øe they are his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115140:76"/>own goods that be hath bought by his own mony: but the Thief, when the Con≈øtable comes, and ≈øearch is made, every Trunk that is opened, his heart trembles: It is ≈øo with an un≈øound-hearted man; a man that hath fal≈øe a≈ø≈øurance, he is afraid to be ≈øearched in point of his a≈ø≈øurance, le≈øt there ≈øhould be a flaw found in it. Come to a man that hath fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øions, (as to your Formali≈øts, and tho≈øe that are pre≈øumptuous to wretches) come to the≈øe men, and put this que≈øtion unto them, Upon what ground do you hope for ≈øalvation.? What evidence can you give of your effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al calling? How can you make out upon Scripture-grounds, that you ≈øhall go to heaven? Such que≈øtions as the≈øe will puzzle an un≈øound heart, that he cannot give you any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable an≈øwer at all. And herein the difference is palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble between a grounded a≈ø≈øurance and the≈øe fal≈øe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øions that wicked men have.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, True a≈ø≈øurance, whereever it is, it makes a man ≈øo to value the comforts of the Spirit of God, that he doth undervalue all other comforts in the world in compari≈øon of them, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon me;</hi> what then? <hi>and this ≈øhall more glad my heart, then when my corn and wine and oile increa≈øeth.</hi> Beloved, a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it doth ≈øo tran≈øport and rai≈øe up the heart, that it makes all things in the world, all comforts here below to be nothing in compari≈øon of that. The favour of Princes is nothing to that man that hath the favour of God; Life, and all the comforts of life, are nothing to that man that hath comfort in reference to his eternal life; <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindne≈ø≈øe, O Lord, is better then life. David</hi> did not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue his life, nor all the comforts of it, ≈øo as he valued the loving kindne≈ø≈øe of his God. But now, a man that hath fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øions, the≈øe do not ≈øo tran≈øport his ≈øpirit, and take up the whole man, and fill the ≈øoul <hi>with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpeakable and full of glory;</hi> the≈øe do no whit abate his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in the world. A man you know that hath ta≈øted hony, other things are of an unplea≈øant ta≈øte to him that are eaten after: Beloved, a≈ø≈øurance it is like hony; nothing ≈øo ≈øweet to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115140:77"/>godly palate, as that is Now when a godly per≈øon ta≈øtes of the hony of a≈ø≈øurance, all other outward comforts, they are but as gall and wormwood, things unplea≈øant to his ta≈øte and palate. And thus you ≈øee I have laid down ten particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to you. I would intreat you to di≈øtingui≈øh in your own hearts, whether you are the people that have a true a≈ø≈øurance, or onely fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øions of your effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And let me tell you, the rea≈øon why I ≈øpeak of this, is, becau≈øe the mo≈øt of men in the world do mi≈ø≈øe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øions. Where de≈øperation damnes one ≈øoul, pre≈øumption damns a thou≈øand. I might ≈øay of this, as it was ≈øung in the Triumphant ≈øong of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul, Saul hath ≈ølain his thou≈øands, but David his ten thou≈øands:</hi> So I might ≈øay, de≈øperation hath ≈ølain a thou≈øand, but pre≈øump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ten thou≈øand. Thou≈øands and ten thou≈øands are ≈ølain and undone for ever, by harbouring pre≈øumptuous and groundle≈ø≈øe per≈øwa≈øions of their effectual calling, when they are not.</p>

And the≈øe I would advi≈øe to three particular duties.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, you ≈øhould be directed rightly to u≈øe your a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:115140:78"/>Secondly, Carefully to pre≈øerve your a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Daily to improve your a≈ø≈øurance. This is the threefold task that lies upon you, that enjoy this rich jewel of a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, You are to take care, that you rightly u≈øe and manage your a≈ø≈øurance. A thing hardly gotten, if it be not well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, a man may enjoy it in a way of lo≈ø≈øe to him≈øelfe. To u≈øe a≈ø≈øurance well is the great Art of a Chri≈øtian. And here (that I might ≈øpeak di≈øtinctly to this direction) I ≈øhall lay down eight particulars, as concomitants, or gracious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which mu≈øt accompany you in a condition of a≈ø≈øurance; As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, You mu≈øt u≈øe and manage your a≈ø≈øurance with humility, in ca≈øe you u≈øe it well. A≈øsured Chri≈øtians mu≈øt be humble Chri≈øtians. The more high you are in comforts, the more low you ≈øhould be in Spirit. You know the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øt eares of corn hang down their head lowe≈øt, when light and fla≈øhy darnel that hath nothing of worth in it, lifts up its head on high. A≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians, they are like your full and ripe eares of corn; the more full they are of this fruit of the Spirit, a≈ø≈øurance, the more low do they, and ≈øhould they hang down their heads. It is your empty bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels make a noi≈øe, when your full ve≈ø≈øels though you ≈øtrike them, will not ≈øound: It is tho≈øe Chri≈øtians that are mo≈øt empty of faith, and mo≈øt empty of a≈øsurance, that make mo≈øt noi≈øe, and are mo≈øt proud of their gifts and graces; when your a≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians they are like ve≈øsels full of the be≈øt liquor; that makethe lea≈øt noi≈øe. The fuller God hath fil'd you with this comfort, the more you ≈øhould ≈øhine forth in humility. As <hi>Paul</hi> when he ≈øaith, <hi>Chri≈øt loved him, and gave him≈øelfe for him;</hi> when he was mo≈øt full of comforts, he was mo≈øt fill'd with humility, and ≈øaid, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chri≈øt liveth in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, You mu≈øt manage your a≈øsurance with a high valuation of the comforts of God in you. A man that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a benefit, if he do not value it, it is a provocation to the man that gave it, either to repent of his gift, or take it
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115140:78"/>away. <hi>David</hi> when he had a≈øsurance, mark how he values it: <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindne≈ø≈øe is better then life.</hi> He va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued the comforts of his God, and the ≈øhining of Gods countenance better then life. And <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me, and that ≈øhall more glad me, then when my corn and wine and oile increa≈øeth. David</hi> would more value the comforts of Gods Spirit, then any other comfort in the world. A≈øsured Chri≈øtians, that u≈øe a≈øsurance rightly, they mu≈øt put a high valuation and worth upon it. And the rea≈øon is, Becau≈øe you will not then ea≈øily part with your a≈øsurance for a ba≈øe and beggerly lu≈øt, and for a fruitle≈øse ≈øinne, if once you know the value and worth of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Your a≈øsurance mu≈øt make you to live with a weaned heart from the comforts of this world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. the la≈øt ver≈øe, compared with Chapt. 5.1. The Apo≈øtle tels you, <hi>We doe not look after the things that are ≈øeen, that are temporal.</hi> What made the Apo≈øtle not to look after world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things? he gives the rea≈øon, <hi>For when this hou≈øe of ours is di≈ø≈øolved, we have a dwelling with God, eternal in the heavens.</hi> As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, That's the rea≈øon we do not look after the world, as worldly men do; for we know that when we leave this world, we have a heaven to go to. The a≈øsurance of the Ble≈øsednes of their future being, did make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the world, as a thing not worthy the glance of the eye; Per≈øons that have a≈øsurance, can ≈øay as <hi>Philip</hi> ≈øaid to Chri≈øt, <hi>John</hi> 14.8. <hi>Shew us,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Philip, the Father, and it ≈øufficeth us.</hi> Thus ≈øaith a gracious heart, O ≈øweet Je≈øus, ≈øhew us but thy favour; a≈øsure but my ≈øoule, that thy Father is a reconciled Father to me in thy ≈øelfe, that he is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as well as thy Father; Shew me but the Father, and it ≈øufficeth me; though I have little or nothing in the world, this ≈øhall ≈øuffice me. Gracious hearts, that live in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a≈øsurance, they ought to live with a weaned heart from the comforts of this world. Men that have ta≈øted hony or ≈øome other ≈øweet mor≈øel, they do di≈øta≈øte all other things, though of them≈øelves very plea≈øant: So men that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115140:79"/>have ta≈øted of this hony of Gods love, and the ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe of this grace of a≈ø≈øurance; it will make them di≈øta≈øte and di≈øreli≈øh all the things of this world, though of them≈øelves plea≈øant &amp; good. If a man look on the Sun it dazles his eyes, that he cannot di≈øcern colours about him; ≈øo he that beholds the light of Gods countenance, will not look upon the things here below. I may allude to that place, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.39. <hi>No man,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>having drunk old wine, ≈øtraight way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øireth new; for he ≈øaith, The old is better.</hi> His meaning is this, No man that hath had a ta≈øte of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, &amp; hath had communion and fellow≈øhip with Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and lain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mini≈øtery of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; no man that hath drunk of this old wine, will ≈øay, new is better; to have other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and other plea≈øures, is better; no man will ≈øay this, ≈øaith Chri≈øt. And ≈øo he compares his Mini≈øtery, and his doctrine, and the comfort Gods people have thereby, to old wine: Beloved, ≈øo I ≈øay, men that have drunk draughts of this wine of con≈øolation, and men that are ≈øet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No, the a≈øsurance of Gods love ≈øhould wean a mans heart from all the comforts of the world. As old <hi>Jacob</hi> ≈øaid, when he ≈øaw his ≈øonne <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> in his old age, after he had made many a prayer, and ≈øhed many a tear; <hi>O Jo≈øeph my ≈øonne is yet alive, I have enough.</hi> As was the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> the ≈øame ≈øhould be the carriage of a Chri≈øtian towards Chri≈øt. If he can ≈øay, My <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> my Je≈øus is alive in my heart; I having him, have enough; this comfort ≈øhould ravi≈øh his ≈øpirit. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was rapt up into the third heaven, was ≈øo tran≈øported that he knew not whether he was in the body or no; ≈øo are the people of God ravi≈øhed with heavenly con≈øolations, that they minde not the≈øe earthly things.

               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:115140:79"/>Fourthly, you are to manage and u≈øe your a≈øsurance with tenderne≈øs of con≈øcience again≈øt ≈øinne. A≈øsured Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians ≈øhould be tender-con≈øcienced Chri≈øtians. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>God will ≈øpeak peace to his people;</hi> but mark the duty: <hi>they mu≈øt not turn again unto folly.</hi> They mu≈øt not run again into ≈øinne, they mu≈øt be tender of ≈øin, and then God will ≈øpeak peace to his people. Sin (as I once told you) will be like wind in the bowels of the earth. Philo≈øophers ≈øay, Earthquakes and ruptures are occa≈øioned by winde got into the bowels and cavernes of the earth, which having no place for vent, it overturnes mountaines and buildings: Beloved, ≈øinne in the heart will do the like; it will make the heart quake and tremble if it be there; it will prove the grave of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and the re≈øurrection of thy feares. Therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians that are a≈øsured, they mu≈øt take heed of ≈øinne; if they would keep their comforts, they mu≈øt keep their hearts that ≈øin get not into their con≈øciences. Beloved, they that are a≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians, they know how difficultly they did attain this a≈ø≈øurance, and they know how ≈øweetly they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy this a≈ø≈øurance, and that will make them very tender, that they do not lo≈øe a thing ≈øo hardly gotten and ≈øweetly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed for a trivial lu≈øt; that they lo≈øe not their former evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and revive former terrors.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, A≈ø≈øurance mu≈øt be managed with patience in bearing any outward affliction that you may meet with in the world. A≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians mu≈øt be patient Chri≈øtians, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>They ≈øuffered joyfully the ≈øpoyling of their goods, knowing that they had in heaven a better and more enduring ≈øub≈øtance;</hi> and that made the Saints of God tu≈øh and ≈øcorn at all the lo≈ø≈øes they met with in the world. Suppo≈øe a man be at Sea, and have precious jewels and pearles aboard with him; if the man can be but ≈øure he ≈øhall ≈øave his own life, and ≈øave his jewels, though he lo≈øe the Casket, though he lo≈øe the box, that will not much trouble him: Thou that art ≈øure of heaven, thou can≈øt never lo≈øe that pearle, thy ≈øoul; thou mai≈øt lo≈øe the ≈øhell, thy life; thou mai≈øt lo≈øe the Casket, thou ≈øhalt never lo≈øe the jewel; and ≈øhall that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115140:80"/>thee? If thou art an a≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtian, be ≈øure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ≈øtorme of Temptation blow upon thee, thou ≈øhalt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lo≈øe the box, never lo≈øe the pearle. This therefore ≈øhould make a≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians to be patient Chri≈øtians, what ever they ≈øhall undergo here in the world. I have read a ≈øtory in <hi>Fox</hi> his Acts and Monuments, of a woman, who when ≈øhe came to be tried for her Religion before <hi>Bonner,</hi> that bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Bi≈øhop; he threatened her, he would take away her hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band from her; ≈øaith ≈øhe, Chri≈øt is my husband; I will take away thy childe: Chri≈øt, ≈øaith ≈øhe, is better to me then ten ≈øonnes; I will ≈øtrip thee, ≈øaith he, of all thy outward comforts: yea but Chri≈øt is mine, and you cannot ≈øtrip me of him, ≈øaith ≈øhe. The thoughts of this bore up the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans heart; ≈øpoile her of all, and take away all, yet Chri≈øt was hers, and they could not take him away. O Beloved, when thy ≈øoul lives in the a≈ø≈øurance of Gods love, and of thy calling to grace and glory; this ≈øhould make you wonderful patient to endure what ever you ≈øhall meet with here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. It was the ≈øpeech of that famous ≈øervant of God, holy <hi>Bradford,</hi> when a company of his fellow pri≈øoners were that morning to go to be burnt, ≈øaith <hi>Bradford,</hi> O my fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øufferers, be chearful, for though we are all of us to have a bitter breakfa≈øt, yet truly we ≈øhall have a chearful dinner. Here you ≈øee how a≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians, their comforts in God did ≈øo tran≈øport their hearts, that it made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look, and with patience bear all afflictions they were to meet with. You have a remarkable phra≈øe, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 33.24. <hi>The Inhabitants of Sion ≈øhall not ≈øay, I am ≈øick, the people that dwell therein, ≈øhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> A ≈øtrange pa≈øsage; he doth not ≈øay, they were not ≈øick, but the text ≈øaith, they ≈øhould not ≈øay ≈øo. And what's the rea≈øon? why ≈øhould the people forget their ≈øorrows, &amp; forget their pains? this ≈øhould make them; the Lord had forgiven them their iniquities. The ≈øen≈øe of pardon took away the ≈øen≈øe of pain. And Beloved, Chri≈øtians ≈øhould walk thus to ≈øhew that trouble ≈øhould not daunt them, and afflictions never ≈øtartle them; you that are a≈øsured Chri≈øtians, you ≈øhould be patient
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115140:80"/>Chri≈øtians under all ≈øufferings. And take this for a rule, that God takes impatience more unkindly at a≈øsured Chri≈øtians hands, then at the hands of any men in the world be≈øides: Becau≈øe if God give thee a≈øsurance, he hath given thee a ≈øeal in thy own bre≈øt, that all ≈øhall work for thy good; and wilt thou be impatient? He hath given thee a ≈øeal in thy own bre≈øt, that heaven ≈øhall make amends for all; and wilt thou be angry? God will take this more unkindly at them then any.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, A≈øsurance ≈øhould be managed with indeared love to Je≈øus Chri≈øt. A≈øsured Chri≈øtians ≈øhould be Chri≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loving Chri≈øtians. When Chri≈øt told <hi>Mary Magdalen, Thy ≈øins which are many are forgiven thee,</hi> When ≈øhe had a≈øsurance, her ≈øinnes were pardoned, what ≈øaith Chri≈øt? <hi>Much was forgiven her, therefore ≈øhe loved much:</hi> becau≈øe ≈øhe was ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble much was forgiven her, ≈øhe would ≈øhew forth much love to Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe it was Chri≈øts love brought tho≈øe Chri≈øtians into a State of ≈øalvation, and his love likewi≈øe that gave them a≈øsurance of their own call, and this ≈øhould indear their hearts to Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, A≈øsurance ≈øhould be managed with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of compa≈ø≈øion towards tho≈øe Chri≈øtians that are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted &amp; troubled by Satan. A≈øsured Chri≈øtians ≈øhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øionate Chri≈øtians. If God have given you a≈øsurance of his love, you ≈øhould carry compa≈ø≈øionate bre≈øts towards your Brethren, who remain behinde in great di≈øtre≈øs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, that lie to≈øsed and turmoiled by Temptations. When a ≈øhip is brought ≈øafe to the haven, if they have any bowels, when they ≈øee another ≈øhip in the main Ocean ≈øtrugling for life in the mid≈øt of the waters, they will pity them: You that have got a≈øsurance, you are come to a ≈øafe harbour; but your tempted Brethren, they are to≈øsed upon the waves and tempe≈øts of temptation, you ≈øhould now have compa≈ø≈øionate hearts towards tempted Chri≈øtians. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. The Apo≈øtle tells us, <hi>The Lord hath comforted us in all our tribulation, that we might comfort others with the ≈øame comforts, wherewith we our ≈øelves are comforted of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115140:81"/>God.</hi> It was the work and task of the Apo≈øtle, and them with him, that they having comforts and a≈ø≈øurance from God, they would labour to comfort others, and bear up others, and e≈øtabli≈øh others, that they might rejoyce, and receive the ≈øame comforts with them≈øelves. Hence you read, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>Be pitiful, be compa≈ø≈øionate to your Brethren, love as Brethren.</hi> Now upon what ground doth the Apo≈øtle pre≈ø≈øe this compa≈ø≈øion. Read ver≈øe 9. <hi>Knowing,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>that you are hereunto called, that you ≈øhould inherit a ble≈ø≈øing.</hi> As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, upon this ground I woo you to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øionate becau≈øe you are called to inherit a ble≈ø≈øing; that is, you know and are a≈ø≈øured, that you are a ble≈ø≈øed people, and you ≈øhall be a ≈øaved people, therefore have compa≈ø≈øion on your brethren, who are tempted and troubled, that you might bring them to the ≈øame pitch of comfort you are brought to.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, A≈ø≈øurance ≈øhould be managed with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of heart: A≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians ≈øhould be chearful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians. We read <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.1, 2. That <hi>Nehemiah</hi> all the while he was before the face of the King, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of the King, the Text ≈øaith, <hi>Nehemiah for a long time was not ≈øad:</hi> the Kings pre≈øence did ≈øo cheare up <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> heart. Now to this I would allude: If the pre≈øence and face of King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> did make <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that for a long time he was not ≈øad before him; Oh how much more ≈øhould the face of God, and the pre≈øence of God in a mans ≈øoul, and the favour of God towards a man, how much more ≈øhould this keep thee from being ≈øad in Gods pre≈øence, from a lumpi≈øh and Melancholy and ≈øad ≈øpirit? Thou art in the pre≈øence of a King, in the favour of God, and this ≈øhould keep thee from being ≈øad and heavy. None in the world have greater grounds of joy then tho≈øe that live in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant a≈ø≈øurance of the love of God towards them. It is for condemned men, that are condemned to the Gallows, to hang down their heads and wring their hands; but let the pardoned people of the Lord rejoyce. The man that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, he hangs down his head, but the man that comes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115140:81"/>pardoned from the barre, with what a chearful countenance will that man come? you are all a people pardoned by your God, you may well be a rejoycing people: I remember a pa≈ø≈øage I have read in D. <hi>Halls</hi> Works, in his Meditations upon the Creatures, ≈øpeaking of a little Bird called Robbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red-bre≈øt, that when he was in his ≈øtudy, came chirping at the window, and leaping upon his book, and ≈øinging a great while together; upon this ≈øight he breaks out into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. O this little ≈øilly Bird, that doth not know where to pick up the next crum, that doth not know where to pitch and re≈øt it ≈øelfe for the next night, yet behold, how chearfully doth this Bird ≈øing, when man, and a Chri≈øtian man that knows God to be his Father, that hath not only crumbs of ourward ble≈ø≈øings but whole mor≈øels of inward comfort, and can drink draughts of inward con≈øolation: Chri≈øtians, that have a God, and a heaven, that have Chri≈øt and glory, yet they cannot be merry, as a poor Bird can be: and truly it is a good Meditation: Many times people that are called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and have ground and a≈ø≈øurance of their everla≈øting happine≈ø≈øe by him, yet they cannot be ≈øo merry as a poor Bird will be; Birds in the morning will be chirp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ≈øinging, as if nothing lay at the heart, when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian is ≈øad, and vexing, and wearying out his life in di≈øcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and ≈øorrowes; this becomes not a Chri≈øtian. A≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians they ≈øhould be chearful Chri≈øtians.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, A≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians they ≈øhould be thankful Chri≈øtians. For one to give a man a promi≈øe, it is worth thanks, but when a man ≈øhall not onely give, but a≈ø≈øure that Promi≈øe, that he will make it good; that is more thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. Beloved, if God had only promi≈øed you a heaven, and had given no a≈ø≈øurance, it was thanks-worthy, but when God ≈øhall give thee his Broad Seal, that ≈øhall ≈øeal thee up to the day of Redemption, and when God ≈øhall give thee an a≈ø≈øurance in thy own bre≈øt, thou ≈øhalt go to heaven, and go to God, this ≈øhould much more make thee in thy Spirit ble≈ø≈øe thy God. It is a ≈øpeech of the Prophet <hi>David, My ≈øoule, ble≈ø≈øe thou the Lord for his marvellous loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe.</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:115140:82"/>Thou ha≈øt kindne≈ø≈øe, and thou ha≈øt marvellous loving kindne≈ø≈øe; My ≈øoul ble≈ø≈øe God for this. <hi>David</hi> would not keep back Gods prai≈øes, ≈øeeing God would not keep back Davids comforts. In heaven we ≈øhall break forth into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, becau≈øe we have good things in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; here we ≈øhould break forth into thank≈øgiving, becau≈øe we have them in expectation. And thus I have done with the fir≈øt part of my direction to you that are a≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians, you ≈øhould labour fir≈øt rightly to u≈øe your a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All you that are a≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians, you are to be directed carefully to keep and pre≈øerve your a≈ø≈øurance. There is no le≈ø≈øe skill, ≈øaith the Poet, to be put forth in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue,
<note place="margin">Non minor e≈øt virtus qu√†m quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere parta tueri.</note> then in getting of it. It is ≈øaid of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he was a skilful ≈øouldier to get victories, but he had no skill to keep them, when gotten; It may be ≈øaid ≈øo of us, Chri≈øtians can get a≈ø≈øurance, but they have not the skill to keep it, when they have got it. This therefore I am now to pre≈øs, that you would be careful to pre≈øerve your a≈ø≈øurance. And here in ≈øpeaking of this, I ≈øhall lay down two particulars; that in ca≈øe you would keep your a≈ø≈øurance, there are ≈øome things you mu≈øt do; and ≈øome things you mu≈øt avoid and take heed of.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, There are ≈øome things you mu≈øt do, and tho≈øe I ≈øhall comprize under 2 or 3 heads.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, In ca≈øe you would keep a≈ø≈øurance, you are to keep clo≈øe in communion with your God, in the exerci≈øe of the duty of godline≈ø≈øe. The more you keep grace, the more you will keep your comforts. And here that I may branch out this direction, I ≈øhall comprize the≈øe duties under four heads, and ≈øhew you from Scripture, that keeping clo≈øe to God in the u≈øe of four duties, will be a ready way to keep your a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in you.</p>
               <p>As fir≈øt, keep clo≈øe to God in the duty of prayer, <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>Ask,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>and your joy ≈øhall be full.</hi> Ask, that your joy may be full; implying that if you keep clo≈øe to God in the duty of prayer, after a≈ø≈øurance; your ≈øpirits ≈øhall be compleat and full.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Keep clo≈øe to God, in the duty of reading the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115140:82"/>Word often. By often reading the Word, you will often meet with Promi≈øes and ≈øupports for your comfort. That's the rea≈øon men le≈ø≈øen in comforts, becau≈øe men do not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently read the Word; you cannot read a Chapter, but you will finde there a prop for faith, and a prop for a≈ø≈øurance. Keeping con≈øtant to the Word, and that's the way to keep your a≈ø≈øurance, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13. <hi>The≈øe things have I written to you that believe, that you might know, that you have eternal life.</hi> The≈øe things have I writ, not onely, that you have life, but that you might know it. By reading the writings of <hi>John, John</hi> tells them, they might the better know they ≈øhould live for ever, and everla≈øtingly be ≈øaved. Keep clo≈øe to God in reading his written Word, and this will be of great u≈øe. Becau≈øe there are Promi≈øes ≈øcattered throughout the veines of Scripture. Not a Scripture almo≈øt you can read, but there is a promi≈øe or ≈øupport for your faith one way o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Keep clo≈øe to God in a con≈øtant and con≈øcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearing of his Word, and this is a great means to get a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.76. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt be called the Prophet of the Highe≈øt, for thou ≈øhalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his way;</hi> that is, thou ≈øhalt go to prepare the peoples hearts that they may receive Je≈øus Chri≈øt that followes after. This is ≈øpoken of <hi>John Bapti≈øt.</hi> And what was the effect of hearing <hi>John</hi> preach? <hi>To give knowlege of ≈øalvation to his people, for the remi≈ø≈øion of their ≈øins;</hi> not onely to give them ≈øalvation, but to give them knowledge and a≈ø≈øurance of this ≈øalvation. O live under the Mini≈øtery, and under <hi>John Bapti≈øts</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery, that preacheth repentance and humiliation, and that is the Mini≈øtery will give mo≈øt a≈ø≈øurance of your ≈øalvation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Keep in communion with God, in a daily try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and examining your own hearts. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>If any man think him≈øelfe to be ≈øomewhat, when he is nothing, he deceiveth him≈øelfe; but let every man prove his own works, and then he ≈øhall have rejoycing in him≈øelfe.</hi> That is, let a man examine him≈øelfe, and prove his heart, and this will be a means to work joy in the heart, that they ≈øhall have comfort and joy
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115140:83"/>in them≈øelves in the a≈ø≈øurance of their happine≈øs. Beloved what's the rea≈øon you do not keep a≈øsurance? the rea≈øon is, you keep not clo≈øe to God in a way of communion in the≈øe duties of holine≈øse, you keep not to God in a way of prayer, and reading, and examining your hearts, and proving your comforts, and your own e≈øtate, and that's the rea≈øon you are no more full, and no more firm.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you would keep your comforts, keep your con≈øcience clear from harbouring the guilt of linne, <hi>Job</hi> 11.14 15. <hi>I iniquity be in thy hands, put it far away;</hi> if ≈øinne be in thy conver≈øation, away with it. Let not ≈øinne be in thy heart, nor in thy hou≈øe; <hi>then ≈øhalt thou li≈øt up thy face to God without ≈øpot, thou ≈øhalt be ≈øtedfa≈øt before him, and not fear.</hi> This will ballance thy ≈øpirit, and keep thy heart from fear, and keep thee in a ≈øtedfa≈øt a≈øsurance, if thou keep thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience clear.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If thou would≈øt keep a≈øsurance, gather and heap together all the experiences thou ha≈øt had of God in thy heart in times pa≈øt. <hi>I called to remembrance the dayes of old, P≈øal.</hi> 77.7. Call to remembrance all the experiences thou ha≈øt had of God, and had of Chri≈øt, and of thy own grace, and the fruits of Gods Spirit in thy own ≈øoul, and this will wonderfully keep up thy a≈øsurance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. The Apo≈øtle tels us, <hi>Experience worketh hope.</hi> The more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental you are, and the more you gather experience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the more you ≈øtrengthen hope, and the more hope is ≈øtrengthened, the more a≈øsurance is gained. The≈øe are the particulars you mu≈øt practi≈øe, in ca≈øe you would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve in your bre≈øt this a≈øsurance of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are ≈øome things you are to avoid and take heed of, in ca≈øe you would perpetuate a≈øsurance in your hearts, and tho≈øe I ≈øhall comprize under ≈øix heads.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Take heed you do not wallow in, and give your ≈øelves to ≈øen≈øual joy and plea≈øure. There is nothing in the world will more eat out ≈øpiritual joy and that effectual a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance in your hearts, then giving your ≈øelves too much to carnal joy and ≈øen≈øual plea≈øure, which takes away the heart.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115140:83"/>The more your joy runnes in that channel after ≈øen≈øual plea≈øure, the le≈øs it runs towards God, and the comforts that are above; godly ≈øorrow is the ≈øeed plot of ≈øpiritual joy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The evill of earthly mindedne≈øs, take heed of that, if ever you would keep your comforts. There is nothing in the world will more bla≈øt your comforts, then an earthly minde to be ≈øtill poring upon the things of the world. What the Philo≈øophers ≈øay of the Eclip≈øe of the Sun, that it is occa≈øioned by the intervening of the Moon between the Sun &amp; our ≈øight is true in this ca≈øe. The Moon is an emblem of the world. If the world get between Chri≈øt <hi>the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈ønes</hi> and our ≈øight, it will darken our ≈øight of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and bring eclip≈øes upon our comforts and graces. Tho≈øe men that dig deepe≈øt into the bowels of the earth, they are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times choaked and ≈øtifled by damps that come from the earth: So it is with Chri≈øtians, tho≈øe that will be ever poring and digging about the things of this world, it is a thou≈øand to one, if from worldly things a damp doth not ari≈øe to ≈ømother their comforts, and quench their graces; the world pierceth with ≈øorrow, therefore mu≈øt needs damp your joys. A candle, though it may ≈øhine to the view of all, yet put it but under ground; and (though there be not a puffe of winde) the very damps will ≈øtifle the light of the flame. Beloved, though you ≈øhine like candles in your comforts, yet bring them but under the earth, and a clod of earth will ≈øtifle your candle, will damp your comforts. There is nothing laies a Chri≈øtian under more lo≈ø≈øe in his a≈ø≈øurance then worldly-mindedne≈øs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Avoid remi≈ø≈øene≈øs in religious duties. If you ≈ølack in duties, you will ≈ølack in comforts; le≈ø≈øe duties, and le≈ø≈øe comforts go together. If a man doth let loo≈øe the tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of his ≈øhip, and let ≈ølack the ≈øailes, that ≈øhip cannot go with ≈øo ≈øwift a motion; ≈øpecially if winde and tide be again≈øt it, the ≈øhip mu≈øt needs go backward: Believers that are a≈ø≈øured Chri≈øtians, they are like a ≈øhip under ≈øaile; you go again≈øt winde and tide, again≈øt nature, and again≈øt corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, again≈øt Temptation and the devil and all: now if you let ≈ølack your ≈øailes, and grow remi≈ø≈øe in duties, you will
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115140:84"/>quickly ≈ølack in your comforts; whatever weakens your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ≈øtraitens your duties, will impaire your a≈øsurances, and eclip≈øe your comforts; and therefore take heed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øsene≈øs in a way of duties; oh do not le≈øs work, when you have mo≈øt encouragement.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Take heed of ≈øpiritual pride. If once you begin to admire your ≈øelves, you then lo≈øe your ≈øelves. If once you are proud of your graces, it is a provocation to make God take away your comforts, and to make you lo≈øe your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; I mean, lo≈øe them, not in the very being, but in the comfort and exerci≈øe of them; pride it is the great mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of a Chri≈øtians comforts.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take heed of grieving the Spirit of God; <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>whereby you are ≈øealed to the day of Redemption.</hi> The Spirit of God is a ≈øealing Spirit; O grieve not this Spirit.
<note place="margin">It√† nos tractat Spiritus ≈øicut tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatur.</note> The Spirit deals with us, as we deal with it; If you grieve the Spirit of God, God will grieve you, and your ≈øpirits ≈øhall be grieved, that you ≈øhall not keep the joyes of the Lord in your bre≈øt in the a≈ø≈øurance of his love and favour to you. You read, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 63.10. <hi>They grieved his Spirit, ≈øo he was turned to be their enemy, and fought again≈øt them.</hi> Beloved, though God may be your friend, yet he will frown upon you as an enemy, and ≈øeem to fight again≈øt you too, in ca≈øe you grieve his Spirit; if thou grieve Gods Spirit, God will grieve thine, and when thy ≈øpirit is grieved, thou mu≈øt needs lo≈øe thy comforts.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Take heed of the ≈øinne of hypocri≈øie, fal≈øe grace will breed a fal≈øe joy. A fal≈øe heart mu≈øt needs have fal≈øe comforts. You will never keep true comforts, if you have an un≈øound heart. <hi>The upright in heart they ≈øhall ≈øhout upon their beds for joy;</hi> they ≈øhall do it, but hypocrites ≈øhall not. Take heed therefore of this evill, and you are in a way to pre≈øerve your a≈ø≈øurance.</p>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>2 PET. 1.10.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <q>Wherefore the rather, Brethren, Give all diligence to make your Calling and Election ≈øure.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Doctrine I am yet upon is this, <hi>That Chri≈øtians ought to put forth a great deal of diligence to make this ≈øure to their ≈øoules, that they are effectually called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> In the managing of which I came to an u≈øe of direction, to tho≈øe who are a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their effectual calling, and to them I gave three directions. Fir≈øt, That you would rightly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage your a≈ø≈øurance. Secondly, Carefully pre≈øerve your a≈ø≈øurance. Thirdly, Daily improve your a≈ø≈øurance; the la≈øt of which I have yet to handle And touching this third direction, daily to improve your a≈ø≈øurance, I ≈øhall give you but three heads; which if you make u≈øe of, you may every day improve your a≈ø≈øurance, and bring it from a little to a great mea≈øure. As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, In ca≈øe you would do this, improve your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The more you increa≈øe in grace, the more you will grow in comfort. Grace and comfort, they are two Twinnes, that the more one growes, the better the other thrives. Hence you read, that in the ≈øaluation of every Epi≈øtle, the Apo≈øtle puts both together, <hi>Grace, mercy, and peace be multiplied to you in Chri≈øt Je≈øus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. There the Apo≈øtle makes the multiplying of grace, to be the multiplying of peace. The more you multiply
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115140:85"/>and grow in grace, the more you will increa≈øe peace, inward peace of con≈øcience: they are both joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. You have a pa≈ø≈øage, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.5, 11. compared together, <hi>Adde to your Faith vertue, &amp;c.</hi> The Apo≈øtle there urgeth our diligence to adde grace to grace; that is, to live in the improvement of grace. And what will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? ver≈øe 11. <hi>If you doe the≈øe things, you ≈øhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall; for ≈øo an entrance ≈øhall be mini≈øtred unto you abundantly into the everla≈øting Kingdome of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> You ≈øhall not onely go to heaven, but you ≈øhall have an abundant entrance mini≈øtred before you come there; you ≈øhall have abundance of a≈ø≈øurance and inward peace before you come there. And here to give you a more particular direction, there are the≈øe foure graces chiefly you are to improve.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Improve the grace of humility. <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 57.15. the Lord doth promi≈øe there <hi>to revive the ≈øpirit of the humble.</hi> It is a particular promi≈øe to that grace, that God will revive you, and give you a new life if you have it. And reviving there is not meant of the fir≈øt life of grace, but of a life of comfort. They had grace before, but God would give them a life of comfort, he will re≈øtore your con≈øolation to you in ca≈øe you are a humble peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Hence it is, <hi>James</hi> 4.6. <hi>The Lord gives grace to the humble.</hi> Yea, <hi>he gives more grace.</hi> The Lord gives more grace to the humble per≈øon then to any man in the world. Now the more grace you have, the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you mu≈øt needs have. Humility is a foundation of more grace, therefore needs mu≈øt be a foundation of more comfort.</p>
               <p>That building, who≈øe foundation is laid lowe≈øt, is of all the mo≈øt beautiful and comely Fabrick above ground: So tho≈øe Chri≈øtians that lay a foundation low in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they are likely to rear up a mo≈øt beautiful Building in way of comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Improve the grace of faith in believing, and that is the way to increa≈øe comfort. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.8.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115140:85"/>
                  <hi>Whom though you have not ≈øeen, yet believing, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with joy un≈øpeakable and full of glory.</hi> Though they did never ≈øee Chri≈øt, yet believing in Chri≈øt, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their faith, they had not only an ordinary mea≈øure of comfort, but they had more comfort in their hearts, then they could utter with their Tongue; <hi>They rejoyce with joy un≈øpeakable and full of glory.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>The God of peace fill you with all joy and peace in Believing, that you may abound in hope through the holy Gho≈øt.</hi> Believing makes you full of all joy, and makes you abound in it. The more you are in Believing, the more you will be in a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Improve the grace of love to Je≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>If any man love me, my Father ≈øhall love him, and we will come in unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> That is, If you improve in your love to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, God the Father and God the Son will make their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in your hearts. Now he mu≈øt needs be a comfortable Chri≈øtian, that hath ≈øo good a gue≈øt as God the Father and Je≈øus Chri≈øt to come in, and make their abode with him. As you know, to your bo≈øome-friend whom you love, and you know loves you, you will communicate all your ≈øecrets: Thus will God the Father, if hee knowes you are his bo≈øome-friends, and ≈øeeth you love him, he will communicate all his comforts to you; you ≈øhall never want comforts, if you increa≈øe in love to Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Improve the grace of godly ≈øorrow; you will never finde ≈øweeter mu≈øick in comfort, then when you are laid down in teares. As the ≈øound of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet is never more plea≈øant then when they are upon the water; ≈øo when God ≈øeeth you flow with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of repentance and godly ≈øorrow, then you are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear the mo≈øt melodious harmony in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion of Gods love; <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 126. <hi>They that ≈øowe in tears, ≈øhall reap in joy.</hi> You ≈øhall not onely have a dram, but a handfull of joy; as Reapers they cut down handfuls
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115140:86"/>of corne at once. And as you know in ≈øeed, though you ≈øowe but one grain of corne, there may a dozen eares come from that one ≈øeed: ≈øo if you ≈øowe but a little godly ≈øorrow, a grain of godly ≈øorrow may be a root to a great deal of ≈øpiritual joy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would improve your a≈ø≈øurance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve a clear con≈øcience, both towards God and man. <hi>A good con≈øcience is a continual fea≈øt, Prov.</hi> 15.15. A≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I may ≈øay of it as a Father ≈øpeaks of the Holy Gho≈øt,
<note place="margin">Res delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta e≈øt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus Dei.</note> and the comforts thereof, The Spirit of God is a very nice thing, every thing will give the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Gods Spirit a check and di≈øta≈øte; now if you harbour ≈øinne upon con≈øcience, you will never thrive in comfort; every thing will give comfortable motions a check. And as Philo≈øophers ≈øay when the Aire is fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, it ari≈øeth from vapours that are exhaled from the earth, which makes the aire ≈øo cloudy as it is; So it is filth drawn from our earthly hearts, that makes ≈øuch foggy mi≈øts to ari≈øe between our comforts and us, and between God and us. You mu≈øt keep con≈øcience clear, el≈øe you will never keep heaven clear. Heaven will be clouded, if the heart be filthy. <hi>Job</hi> 11.14, 15. <hi>If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away;</hi> If ≈øinne be upon the con≈øcience, harbour it not, <hi>for then thou ≈øhalt lift up thy face before God, thou ≈øhalt be ≈øtedfast, and not fear.</hi> You ≈øhall not only not fear, but you ≈øhall have a degree of a≈ø≈øurance. You ≈øhall be ≈øtedfa≈øt, if you put ≈øinne far away from you. A ≈øullied and a polluted con≈øcience ≈øhall never be in a Chri≈øtian ≈øtrong in a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. You will not grow in a≈ø≈øurance, if your con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence harbour guilt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you would improve your a≈ø≈øurance, keep clo≈øe in communion with God. Nothing that feeds comforts ≈øo much as a Chri≈øtians holy walking, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>The work of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe ≈øhall be peace, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof quietne≈ø≈øe and a≈ø≈øurance for ever.</hi> If you walk in works of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and in a way of keeping
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115140:86"/>clo≈øe communion with God; this ≈øhall be peace, and this ≈øhall be quietne≈ø≈øe, and great a≈ø≈øurance. Mark how the Holy Gho≈øt makes a gradation; not onely peace and quietne≈ø≈øe, but a≈ø≈øurance al≈øo: you ≈øhall have the highe≈øt degree of peace, and the highe≈øt ≈øtep of comfort, if you walk diligently in a way of holine≈ø≈øe with your God. And thus much be ≈øpoken to the fir≈øt ≈øort of men, tho≈øe that live in the enjoyment of the a≈ø≈øurance of their effectual calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">∆≤≈øe. </seg>2</label> I have now a word to tho≈øe men that live in the want of this a≈ø≈øurance,  who happily have in times pa≈øt had ≈øome glimmering, and ≈øome dimme ≈øight of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, touching their everla≈øting e≈øtate, and yet are now much clouded and eclip≈øed in their comforts, or have lo≈øt the comforts they once had, what they ≈øhould do to recover it. And to the≈øe I ≈øhall by way of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øpeak only four things.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, That you would ≈øet upon ≈øearching work. Secondly, Upon humbling work. Thirdly, Upon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work. And fourthly, that you would ≈øet upon me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating work: The≈øe four helpes will through Gods Ble≈ø≈øing be very conducible to re≈øtore your wonted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to you.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, My coun≈øel ≈øhall be to you, that you would ≈øet upon ≈øearching and examining work. When you have lo≈øt any thing, the fir≈øt thing you do is to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, where you have lo≈øt it, that you may finde it again. If you have lo≈øt this precious jewel of a≈ø≈øurance, be thus wi≈øe for your ≈øelves; O ≈øet upon ≈øeeking and ≈øearching work. The Scripture gives you this hint, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Let every man ≈øearch his own work, and then he ≈øhall have rejoycing in him≈øelfe.</hi> This is the way to bring in ≈øpiritual joy and ≈øpiritual comfort, to be often deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your own hearts. <hi>David</hi> when he lay under ≈øome foule di≈øtemper, mark how he deales with his own ≈øoule: <hi>Why art thou troubled, O my ≈øoule, and why art thou di≈øquieted within me?</hi> he puts his heart
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115140:87"/>upon the Trial. And here in your ≈øearching work, I would commend five things to your examination.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Search how you got your a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Search how you grounded your a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Search how you managed your a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Search what ≈øhould provoke God to take away your a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and la≈øtly, Search what you would give to God, ≈øo you might regain your former and wonted a≈ø≈øurance. Put the≈øe que≈øtions to your hearts; As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Put upon the ≈øearch, how you got your a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. It may be it was ≈øuch an a≈ø≈øurance as you have had ever ≈øince you were borne from your mothers womb: that you got without care, and without pain; and if ≈øo, this is pre≈øumption, not a≈ø≈øurance; and if you have lo≈øt this, it is well. It is better to be in a ≈øtate of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, then in a ≈øtate of pre≈øumption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Examine how you grounded your a≈ø≈øurance. It may be you bottomed it but upon ≈øelfe, not upon Chri≈øt. It may be, you bottomed it but upon the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta≈øtical delu≈øions of your own hearts, and not upon the grounded evidence of Gods Word; if ≈øo, that your a≈ø≈øurance have had an ill bottome, it is no wonder if God turne it up≈øide-down. If it bee not rightly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will never long bee continued. Examine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon what grounds you have bottomed your a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and if you finde the foundation of your comforts to be ill laid, you mu≈øt pluck up all again.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Search how you managed your a≈ø≈øurance. It may be you managed your a≈ø≈øurance with pride, not humility; it may be with unwatchfulne≈ø≈øe, and carele≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of ≈øpirit, and did not take notice of tho≈øe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and ≈øugge≈øtions that might impaire your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; and if ≈øo, it is no wonder if the devil ≈øowes tares among≈øt your wheat; it is no wonder if the devil have ≈øtollen away your comforts, if you have laid down your watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:115140:87"/>Fourthly, Examine what ≈øpecial cau≈øe there was in your hearts, that might provoke God to cloud you in your comforts, and to take away your a≈ø≈øurance from you. And here that you might a little bee directed in this ≈øearch, you may reduce the cau≈øe of your eclip≈øe, and of the removal of your a≈ø≈øurance, unto this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold head. Either it hath been the commi≈ø≈øion of ≈øome great tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, or el≈øe the omi≈ø≈øion of ≈øome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty duty, that may provoke God to darken your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. As,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, the Commi≈ø≈øion of ≈øome great tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion. Great ≈øins they lay a foundation for great di≈øcomforts in tender con≈øciences.
<note place="margin">Va≈øtare con≈øcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</note> Great ≈øins they lay the con≈øcience wa≈øte; to make it that was as a well-trimmed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paled garden, to be as a ruinous wilderne≈ø≈øe. Great relap≈øes they bring ordinarily dark eclip≈øes upon the ≈øoule. And here that I might put you on this ≈øearch, I would advi≈øe you to ≈øearch what particular ≈øinne it was, and how you might know the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion that might provoke God, to take away your comforts from you. As,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, if ≈øo be God did take away your comforts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the committing of any gro≈ø≈øe ≈øin, then you may be ≈øure that ≈øinne was the occa≈øion. Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the commi≈ø≈øion of any ≈øin, doth bring upon you more then an ordinary mea≈øure of hardne≈ø≈øe of heart, then you may be ≈øure that was the ≈øin. Or,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If any ≈øinne makes you remi≈ø≈øe in ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duties, that was the ≈øinne provoked God to take away your comforts from you. And by ≈øuch a ≈øearch as this, you might finde out, and give a ≈øhrewd gue≈ø≈øe at the particular provocation.</p>
               <p>And here the particular tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions I would have you ≈øearch about, they are ordinarily the≈øe four, that ingages God to take away comforts from a people. As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, the ≈øinne of ≈øuperciliou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and uncompa≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atene≈ø≈øe of ≈øpirit towards doubting Chri≈øtians. If a ≈øoul
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115140:88"/>carries a proud and ≈øupercilious eye over poor Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and carries no compa≈ø≈øion towards doubting ≈øouls. God for that ≈øinne of wanting bowels of compa≈ø≈øion, may bring him to the ≈øame e≈øtate, which he could not compa≈ø≈øionate in other men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ≈øinne of grieving the Spirit; if you grieve Gods Spirit, God will grieve yours, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 63.10. Or,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ≈øinne of ≈øpiritual pride; ordinarily this may be the ≈øinne. Or,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The ≈øinne of worldly-mindedne≈ø≈øe, or eager pur≈øuit after the things of this world. As digging in the earth doth endanger a man to bee ≈øtifled with damps; ≈øo digging and poring in the world brings but a damp upon a Chri≈øtians comforts, and many times ≈øtifles their a≈ø≈øurance. As the Sun is eclip≈øed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpo≈øition of the Moone between it and our ≈øight; ≈øo if the world once get between the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe and you, it will eclip≈øe the Sunne that you ≈øhall not ≈øee the glory of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and ≈øhall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nor gain that intere≈øt in Je≈øus Chri≈øt you had in former time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another cau≈øe you are to ≈øearch; If it be not the commi≈ø≈øion of ≈øome great tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, yet it may be the omi≈ø≈øion of ≈øome nece≈ø≈øary and weighty du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Lord may bring you upon the ≈øtage of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort for omi≈ø≈øion as well as commi≈ø≈øion. If a man doth let but a wound go undre≈ø≈øed, he may as well die, as if you knockt him with a Beetle upon the head: Beloved, if you let your wounds be undre≈ø≈øed, and let your di≈øcomforts be unlooked after, and let all run at ≈øixes and ≈øevens; if you interrupt in your duties, it is ju≈øt with God to interrupt you in your comforts. If you keep not your watch, 'tis no wonder if you are ≈øurprized. There are many Chri≈øtians that grow carele≈ø≈øe in keeping communion with God, that love ≈øeldome reading, and ≈øeldome praying, and ≈øeldome examining their owne
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115140:88"/>hearts; (alas) men ca≈øting away their duties, it makes God in judgement make ≈øtoppage in a way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In your ≈øearching work examine your ≈øelves, what you would do in ca≈øe God ≈øhould re≈øtore to you your former evidences; could you bring your hearts to this temper, that you would think no pains too much to take, no co≈øt too much to give, nothing ≈øhould be irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øom to you that God would have you perform, in ca≈øe he would give you your wonted comforts? If you finde this temper of ≈øpirit in you, this is a very ready way to bring on your comforts, and re≈øtore the joyes of your ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Set upon humbling work: the onely way to gain what you have lo≈øt, is to mourn over your lo≈ø≈øes. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20. See how <hi>Ephraim</hi> comes to have his comforts re≈øtored, when he wept over his own di≈øcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: <hi>I have heard Ephraim bemoaning him≈øelfe,</hi> ≈øaith God, and I ≈øaid, <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ≈øonne, I ≈øaw him ≈ømiting upon his thigh,</hi> humbling his ≈øoul for his ≈øinnes; <hi>and ≈øince I ≈øaw him, I do earne≈øtly remember him, and I will ≈øhew mercy to him.</hi> Here you ≈øee lamenting <hi>Ephraim;</hi> God in the very time of his bemoaning him≈øelf, re≈øtored his comforts to him: we hear many lament for their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lo≈ø≈øes, but who laments for the lo≈ø≈øe of inward comforts? And <hi>David</hi> after he had lo≈øt his comforts by that great ≈øinne of adultery, makes ≈øeven penitential P≈øalmes, P≈øalmes of lamentation or repentance; and he calls one of them, <hi>A P≈øalm to call to remembrance.</hi> And as an Authour well notes, when <hi>David</hi> came to renew his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, he makes a P≈øalm to call to remembrance tho≈øe ≈øinnes that might provoke God to take away his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from him: So Beloved, let it be your work to make ≈øuch P≈øalms in your Clo≈øets, and make it your practice to call to remembrance tho≈øe evils that provoke God to eclip≈øe your comforts to you, and let that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you. If you cannot find out the Particular ≈øin, labour to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115140:89"/>humble your ≈øoules for every ≈øinne, and then to be ≈øure you cannot mi≈ø≈øe that.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Would you re≈øtore your wonted comforts? then ≈øet upon praying work. This cour≈øe you finde <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> took; <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Make me, O Lord, to hear the voice of joy and gladne≈ø≈øe, that the bones which thou hast broken might rejoyce. Create in me a new heart, and e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble≈øh me with thy free Spirit,</hi> ver≈øe 12. Here you read of <hi>Davids</hi> praying work, how he poured forth his ≈øoule in prayer, that God would re≈øtore to him the joyes of his ≈øalvation. And here in your praying work I would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ca≈øt in three directions.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Pray for a di≈øtinct ≈øight of tho≈øe evils that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God to take your comforts from you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, After you have got a ≈øight, bend the ≈øtrength of your prayers mo≈øt again≈øt tho≈øe evils that did ≈øo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to cloud your comforts. Pray again≈øt them, as again≈øt the deadlie≈øt enemy you have in the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Pray for attaining tho≈øe graces that may be inlets to ≈øpiritual comfort, as the graces before named: the grace of godlie ≈øorrow, the grace of humiliation, the grace of faith, and of love to Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Thus if you ≈øet upon ≈øearching, upon humbling, and upon praying work, you are in a likely way to have your comforts re≈øtored.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Set upon the work of meditation; and in this work, I ≈øhall commend four meditations you are to take into your thoughs, which may be very helpful and u≈øeful to you in re≈øtoring your comforts. As,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Let your meditations run upon this, that ≈øometimes you are not ≈øo competent Judges of your own ≈øpiritual e≈øtate, as others may be; As,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, In a time of de≈øertion, when God hath left you and frownes upon you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In times of temptation, when the devils temptations are violent again≈øt you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In times of Relap≈øe, when you are fallen into ≈øome great ≈øinne; at this time you are not ≈øo compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115140:89"/>Judges of your own e≈øtate, but ≈øtanders by may ≈øee more of your own good, and your own ≈øincerity, then your ≈øelves may do; as the Proverb is: Many times Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on ≈øee more then he that playes the game; it is true in this. A Looker on may ≈øee ≈øincerity ≈øparkle in thy practice, and thy graces ≈øhine in thy conver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when thou can≈øt not do it thy ≈øelfe. A childe when it blubbers and cries, can ≈øee nothing of his book. So when Chri≈øtians are ≈øad, and ≈øullen, and lumpi≈øh, they can hardly read any thing of their evidence. Mr. <hi>Throgmorton</hi> got his a≈ø≈øurance this way, by the Te≈øtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a company of godly Mini≈øters that they could lay their ≈øoules in his ≈øoules ≈øtead. Let this therefore run in your Meditations, that many times ≈øtanders by and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians that behold your walkings, and ≈øee your Actions, they may ≈øee more ground of comfort in you then your ≈øelves can do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Meditate and think upon the comforts God gave you in wonted time, and call them to minde. Do as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 77. <hi>I called to minde the dayes of old, and the yeers of many generations.</hi> Call to minde ancient dayes, did not God ≈øhew thee his face? did not God bear thee in the palmes of his hands? did not God give thee many a ≈ømile of his countenance, and many a pledge of his love, even by affliction it ≈øelfe? did not God ≈øet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ≈øeal upon thy heart, that thy comforts were true, thy evidence clear, and thy ends ≈øincere towards God? Beloved, call to minde the former frame of thy ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, how thou wa≈øt in wonted times, and this Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being backed by Gods Spirit, may bee a great means to re≈øtore thy comforts to thee; pa≈øt goodne≈ø≈øe ≈øhould be pre≈øent encouragement.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Meditate what way it was that you got your former comforts and a≈ø≈øurance;
<note place="margin">Ex quo gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimur eo dem nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</note> and the ≈øame way God will ≈øanctifie to re≈øtore you your comforts again. What Phy≈øicians ≈øay of the body, We are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed of tho≈øe things, of which wee are begotten and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115140:90"/>generated. So I ≈øay of comforts: The very ≈øame thing that begot comforts, the ≈øame will re≈øtore your comforts againe. Now think upon this in your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and con≈øider, What way did I gaine my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in yeeres pa≈øt? did I gaine my comforts by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øorrow, and by lamenting after God, and by mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over tho≈øe abominable failings in my practice? now take the ≈øame cour≈øe to re≈øtore thy evidences. Go and mourn in thy Clo≈øet over thy uneven walking before God. Go lament for thy ≈øinnes, mourne after thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and tell him thou art grieved at the heart that he is ≈øo great a ≈øtranger to thy ≈øoule. Did≈øt thou gain thy a≈ø≈øurance in dayes pa≈øt by humbling thy ≈øoule often before God? Set upon humbling work again. Did≈øt thou gain thy comforts in dayes pa≈øt by walking clo≈øely with thy God? Amend thy paths, and direct thy wayes unto thy Maker for dayes to come. There is the very ≈øame way to re≈øtore your comforts, that was at fir≈øt to gain your comforts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Let your Meditations work upon tho≈øe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Promi≈øes in the Go≈øpel, that hold forth mo≈øt comfort to a dejected ≈øoule. And truly I am per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Chri≈øtians Meditations running more upon their own failings, and their own jealou≈øies, and their own mi≈øtakes, then upon Go≈øpel-Promi≈øes, hath been the great occa≈øion they have layen ≈øo long under a ≈øpirit of bondage, and under a dark eclip≈øe in the want of the comforts of Gods Spirit. Therefore now let your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations work upon tho≈øe Promi≈øes that hold forth mo≈øt comfort to a dejected and de≈øerted ≈øoule. And here. I ≈øhall name five or ≈øixe mo≈øt comfortable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes in the Word; As <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>The Lord that dwells in the high and holy places, he doth revive the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the humble, and of the contrite one.</hi> So <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 66.2. <hi>The Lord dwels in the heavens, and yet with him al≈øo that is of an humble and contrite ≈øpirit, that trembles at his Word;</hi> with him will God dwell. So <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 34.18.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115140:90"/>
                  <hi>The Lord is nigh them that are of a broken heart, even them that are contrite in ≈øpirit. So Luke</hi> 4.18. Je≈øus Chri≈øt was <hi>anointed,</hi> that is, appointed by God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>to preach the Go≈øpel to the poor, to binde up the broken in heart, and to comfort them that mourn.</hi> So <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 66.10. <hi>The Lord will re≈øtore comfort to thee, and to thy Mourners.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12. <hi>The Lord will ≈øtrengthen the weak hands, and feeble knees.</hi> And with that remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and mo≈øt glorious Go≈øpel-promi≈øe I ≈øhall end, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 35.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Strengthen the weak hands, and confirme the feeble knees.</hi> This, ≈øaith God, to weak Chri≈øtians, who≈øe legs can hardly carry their bodies, and their hands hardly reach to their mouthes. Say unto the weak Chri≈øtian in grace, comfort, and confirm and ≈øtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them: <hi>And ≈øay unto them that are of a fearfull heart, Be ≈øtrong;</hi> Poor fearful doubting ≈øoules, that fear every Temptation, and fear every corruption, and fear they ≈øhall lo≈øe the recompence of their reward: Say unto that fearful heart, Be ≈øtrong and fear not. <hi>For your God will come with vengeance, even God will come with recompence, and ≈øave you. And then the eyes of the blinde ≈øhall bee open, and the eares of the deafe ≈øhall bee un≈øtopped;</hi> it is not meant of the bodily eye but tho≈øe that were blinde, and could not ≈øee the my≈øteries of Chri≈øt, and could not read their own comforts; then their eyes ≈øhall be open. And the deaf that, as <hi>E≈øaiah</hi> ≈øaith, refu≈øed to be comforted, that would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to comfort, but would ≈øtop their eares again≈øt all comfortable doctrines, and onely give way to ≈øorrow, their eares ≈øhall be un≈øtopped. <hi>And the lame man ≈øhall leap like a Hart;</hi> the poore halting Chri≈øtian, that halts in his comforts, that is now believing, anon ≈øtaggering; now rejoycing, anon de≈øpairing; the poor lame man ≈øhall leap like a Hart. <hi>And the Tongue of the dumb ≈øhall ≈øing:</hi> the poor man that could not ≈øpeak one word of his owne graces, and of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and touching his own evidence, <hi>the Tongue of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115140:91"/>the dumb ≈øhall ≈øing.</hi> O Beloved, here is your work, in ca≈øe you would bee Chri≈øtians to re≈øtore your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts againe; ≈øet upon the work of Meditation, to think upon the≈øe precious promi≈øes of the Go≈øpell, that hold forth mo≈øt comfort to a drooping and dejected ≈øinner.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THe Doctrine I am yet upon is this, <hi>That Chri≈øtians ought to put forth a great deale of diligence, to make this ≈øure to their ≈øoule, that they are effectually called by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt to Grace and Glory.</hi> In the pro≈øecution of which, I have gone over many particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">∆≤≈øe. </seg>
                  </label> There remains now onely one U≈øe more to di≈øpatch about this ≈øubject,  and then I pa≈ø≈øe to the third point drawn from the≈øe words. And the U≈øe ≈øhall be of Con≈øolation; from all that hath been ≈øaid touching the a≈ø≈øurance of our effectuall Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I ≈øhall onely direct my di≈øcour≈øe to lay down ≈øix or ≈øeven Con≈øolatory Conclu≈øions, to tho≈øe Chri≈øtians who are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, yet happily have not a ≈øen≈øible a≈ø≈øurance of their own calling.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, take this for a truth; that A≈ø≈øurance is nece≈ø≈øary, not for the being, but for the wel-being of a Chri≈øtian. It is not nece≈ø≈øary to his e≈øtate, but to his comfort. It is not nece≈ø≈øary as food is to the life, but onely as phy≈øick is to the body. A man cannot live without food; a man may live without Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øick. A≈ø≈øurance is but as a comfortable Cordiall to the ≈øoule; Grace is as food to keep the ≈øoule alive; though you doe want a≈ø≈øurance, this Cordiall to beare you up.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that many of Gods deare Children, they may lie a very long time in the want of this a≈ø≈øurance, touching their effectuall calling. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 88. it is ≈øaid of <hi>Heman,</hi> 14, 15, 16 ver≈øes, <hi>Lord, why ha≈øt thou ca≈øt off my ≈øoule? and why ha≈øt thou hid thy face from me?</hi> Mark his complaint: <hi>I am ready to die.</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:115140:92"/>And was this onely a fit of de≈øertion, or was it a continued act? yes; Ver≈ø. 16. <hi>From my youth up I ≈øuffer thy terrours, I am di≈øtracted, and thy fierce wrath goes over me. Heman</hi> lay under the ≈øtate of de≈øertion from his childhood; for here he tels you his e≈øtate, that he was not troubled for a day or two, or three, and then his troubles were over; but from his youth up he lay under this perplexity, that he thought God had ca≈øt off his ≈øoule, and the terrours of God lay upon him: And yet this man none que≈øtions his goodne≈ø≈øe. For he was the man, as <hi>Ain≈øworth</hi> thinks, that made this P≈øalm; and ≈øure God would never honour a wicked man to be a pen-man of the Scripture. The P≈øalm is called a golden P≈øalm; and it is ≈øo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe hereby he would teach afflicted con≈øciences, that they may from their youth up lie under great horror, and lie under ≈øad ≈øu≈øpence, concerning their everla≈øting e≈øtate, and yet they may have grace at the root for all this. And <hi>Heman</hi> doth not onely expre≈ø≈øe it, as if he had an ordinary trouble of mind; but he expre≈ø≈øeth it, that he lay under an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary weight of Gods wrath, Ver≈ø. 7. <hi>thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>≈øt laid me in the lowe≈øt pit of darkne≈ø≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>, and in the deep, and thy wrath it lies heavy upon me.</hi> He did even lie, and ≈øinke, in his own thoughts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ≈øen≈øe of Gods wrath upon him. This therefore is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfortable conclu≈øion, That godly men may not onely by fits and ≈øtarts, but for a long time, for many yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lie under a ≈øtate of ≈øpirituall de≈øertion. For ≈øome men think of <hi>Heman,</hi> that he was above three≈øcore yeeres of age, when he wrote this P≈øalm; yet from his youth up, till that age, he lay under this horrour and perplexity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that many of Gods deare children may be ≈øo long plunged under de≈øertion, and under the want of A≈ø≈øurance, that they may refu≈øe and with≈øtand comforts, when God offers it to them in the Go≈øpel, and yet may have grace ≈øtill. As a man in a fever, or di≈øtracted by ≈øome violent di≈øea≈øe, though you bring him a Cordiall, that may abate his di≈øea≈øe, the man in a fit will throw the gla≈ø≈øe again≈øt the wall, though it be the onely means of his remedy. It is ≈øo with godly men; many times they are ≈øo accu≈øtomed to ≈øadne≈ø≈øe in the want of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115140:92"/>a≈ø≈øurance, that they may refu≈øe comforts when God offers them. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 77.2. It is the ≈øpeech of <hi>A≈øaph, my ≈øoule refu≈øeth to be comforted;</hi> a ≈øtrange ≈øpeech: Though he was offered comfort, yet his ≈øoule refu≈øed it. Here then, Beloved, this may be a very great prop to thee, that thou may≈øt ≈øo long be accu≈øtomed to a cour≈øe of doubting, that thou may≈øt refu≈øe comfort when God tenders it, and yet be a gracious heart ≈øtill.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and this is more comfortable yet. That rather then God will let his people live and die without a≈ø≈øurance, he wil work a≈ø≈øurance in you by a miracle, or by ≈øome unu≈øual or extraordinary way. A famous in≈øtance you have for this, of a Gentlewoman, that once lived in this City, (its Mr. <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> that relates the ≈øtory) one Mris. <hi>Honywood;</hi> who was a famous profe≈ø≈øour of Religion, and a woman that for many yeeres was much troubled in mind for the want of her a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. At length there came a Mini≈øter to her, who endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ≈øettle her hopes and comforts in Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and he urging promi≈øes to her, ≈øhe took it with a kind of indignation &amp; anger, that he ≈øhould offer to pre≈øent any promi≈øe to her, to whom ≈øhe thought it did not belong; and having a Venice gla≈ø≈øe in her hand, ≈øhe holds up the gla≈ø≈øe and ≈øaid, Speak no more to me of ≈øalvation, for I ≈øhall as ≈øurely be damned, as this poore Venice Gla≈ø≈øe ≈øhall be broken again≈øt the wall, throwing it with all her force to break it. But it plea≈øed God, by a miraculous providence to pre≈øerve the gla≈ø≈øe whole. The Mini≈øter ≈øeeing this, took up the gla≈ø≈øe, and ≈øaid, Behold, God mu≈øt by a miracle work faith in you, before you will believe. And from that day, the ≈øtory ≈øaith, ≈øhe was a woman very ≈øtrong in the a≈ø≈øurance of Gods love. Here you ≈øee how God did indulge the infirmity of his poore ≈øervant. Rather then thou ≈øhalt live and die without a≈ø≈øurance, God will bring it about even by a miracle; this woman, it may be, had died una≈ø≈øured, if God had not confirmed her by ≈øome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u≈øuall way. I have read likewi≈øe in the book of Martyrs, of Mr. <hi>Glover,</hi> that all the while he was in pri≈øon, he was under a ≈øtate of de≈øertion, and very much clouded in his comforts, and could not have any apprehen≈øion of Gods love to his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115140:93"/>≈øoule. Yet when he came to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and ≈øaw the ≈øtake, and the fire in which he was to be burnt, he cried out, I have found him, I have found him; and profe≈øt of him≈øelfe, he was as full of joy as his heart could hold. The Lord made the very ≈øight of the Stake to be an inlet to pre≈øent joy. One would have thought that the ≈øight of the ≈øtake ≈øhould have daunted him; whereas he then grew mo≈øt confident.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That though grace in thy heart be unchangeable, yet the ≈øen≈øe and feeling of thy own graces is ≈øubject to great variation and change. Grace in it ≈øelfe is unchangeable. All the divels in hell cannot pluck the meane≈øt believer out of Chri≈øts hand. <hi>Tho≈øe whom thou ha≈øt given me, I will keep,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>and none ≈øhall take them from me. The foundation of God ≈øtands ≈øure;</hi> though thy knowledge, that thou builde≈øt upon that foundation may not be ≈øure to thee. <hi>The Lord knows who are his,</hi> though thou may≈øt not. Grace it ≈øelfe is not change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though thy feeling of grace is ≈øubject to many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and changes. Though grace it ≈øelfe be an un≈øhaken foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, yet our feeling of grace is not ≈øo. In our feeling of grace, we are like the aire, ≈øometimes cleare, ≈øometimes clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; we are like the ≈øea, ≈øometimes ebbing, ≈øometimes flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ebbing in your comforts, as well as flowing in your graces. Believers in their feeling of grace, are like the Trees of the field, ≈øometimes flouri≈øhing green, and growing; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, at the fall of the leafe, like a withered ≈øtump. So are Chri≈øtians, touching their own feeling; their apprehen≈øion of their graces is ≈øubject to much change, though their graces be not ≈øo.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That the want of A≈ø≈øurance is not ≈øimply prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the ≈øalvation of a Chri≈øtian, though it be prejudiciall to the Con≈øolation of a Chri≈øtian. It is no way prejudiciall to your ≈øalvation, but you may be ≈øaved, though you are not a≈ø≈øured. For fir≈øt, this want of a≈ø≈øurance is no prejudice to your free acce≈ø≈øe to the Throne of grace: you may come freely to pre≈øent your reque≈øts to God, though you are not a≈ø≈øured of acceptance. As it is the ≈øaying of an Authour: Though God ≈øhewes thee not his face, yet he may lend thee
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115140:93"/>his eare, when thou come≈øt to him in prayer; God lends many a Chri≈øtian an eare in prayer, though they ≈øee not his face, nor the glimps of his favour. Secondly, Thy want of a≈ø≈øurance ≈øhall not hinder thy ≈øucce≈ø≈øe in prayer, but thou mai≈øt goe away with an ample returne, though thou doe≈øt not goe away with fulne≈ø≈øe of comfort. <hi>Benjamin</hi> when he was with <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> in Aegypt, he had a token of love from <hi>Io≈øeph,</hi> a Golden Cup in his ≈øacke, though he knew it not. This is a lively Emblem of the carriage of our <hi>Io≈øeph,</hi> Je≈øus Chri≈øt to his young <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins,</hi> who may put a love token in your hearts, and may give you a Golden Cup, and give you grace, and you not know that grace is there. And La≈øtly, It doth not hinder your reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, but you may be at peace with God, though you know not that the agreement is made up; There may be reall friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip between God and a Believer, though there may be ≈øome ≈øeeming enmity. <hi>Thou holde≈øt me for thine enemy</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Iob,</hi> yet God did not, though he thought ≈øo. <hi>Zion</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>the Lord hath for≈øaken me, and my God hath forgotten me,</hi> I≈øa. 49.14. But God had not done ≈øo, for he tells them a little before, almo≈øt in one breath, <hi>Though a mother may forget her ≈øucking child, yet will I not forget you:</hi> So that there may be ≈øome ≈øeeming jarres when there is no enmity at all between God and you.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That Chri≈øtians, who have attained the ≈øtronge≈øt and highe≈øt degree of faith, have yet had many defects and doubtings mingled with their faith. <hi>Lord, I believe,</hi> Mark. 9. <hi>Yet helpe my unbeliefe,</hi> yet that man attained to a high pitch of faith, 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Night and day we pray exceedingly for you that we may ≈øee your face, and perfect that which is wanting in your faith.</hi> Now you mu≈øt not take the≈øe <hi>The≈ø≈øalonians,</hi> as if they were new Converts, or a people weake in the faith; but herein lies the Empha≈øis, that though the≈øe <hi>The≈ø≈øalonians</hi> were the mo≈øt eminent Chri≈øtians of all the world, yet they had a great defect in their faith. Therefore compare this with 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>You were examples to all that believe in</hi> Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, <hi>and</hi> Achaia, <hi>for from you ≈øounded out the word of the Lord not onely in</hi> Macedonia <hi>and</hi> Achaia, <hi>but al≈øo in every place your faith to Godward is ≈øpread abroad.</hi> The people in every place
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115140:94"/>≈øpake of the great mea≈øure of faith that was in the godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Church, and yet though their faith was ≈øo eminent, and they Chri≈øtians ≈øo eminent as they were, yet they had ≈øome defects; and there was ≈øomewhat lacking in their faith for all this. See al≈øo <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 55.5. and <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 77. So that here is very great comfort for Believers, that the ≈øtronge≈øt Chri≈øtians in the faith have had great defects that have attended their graces.</p>
               <p>Thus having fini≈øhed the≈øe ≈øeven comfortable Conclu≈øions, becau≈øe I would have no deluded ≈øinner nuzled up in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumptuous per≈øwa≈øions of his owne ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe, when he is a Cur≈øed man, and de≈øigned for hell; I have two or three ≈øad conclu≈øions to lay down, for all you that harbour ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe and pre≈øumptuous per≈øwa≈øions of your effectuall calling, when you are not. As,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, You that nouri≈øh pre≈øumptuous per≈øwa≈øions of your effectuall calling, when you are not, take this conclu≈øion to dread your hearts, That it is likely you ≈øhall never be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called by Je≈øus Chri≈øt. There is no man ≈øo unlikely to be truely called by Chri≈øt, as that man that thinkes he is called when he is not. <hi>Math.</hi> 9. <hi>I came not to call the Righteous, but ≈øinners to repentance.</hi> Righteous men <hi>i.e.</hi> that thought they were righteous, and in their owne eye thought they had grace and were as good as the be≈øt, <hi>I came not,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>to call them, but ≈øinners, i.e.</hi> ≈øinners, that ≈øee their ≈øinne, and ≈øee their need of a Saviour, and are ≈øen≈øible of their lo≈øt and undone condition without Chri≈øt, Chri≈øt came to ≈øave them, and to call them to repentance: Of all men in the world, you are mo≈øt unlikely to be called that nouri≈øh ungrounded per≈øwa≈øions of your effectuall calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whil≈øt you live in this world, you are meere ≈øtrangers to that inward and ≈øpirituall joy which every true Believer feeles and findeth in Je≈øus Chri≈øt. You <hi>doe not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with tho≈øe inward ≈øolaces, and ≈øweet enjoyments of heart,</hi> which every ≈øincere believer hath in Je≈øus Chri≈øt. A man that hath a≈ø≈øurance upon good ground, he is ≈øo filled with joy, that it wil bear him up again≈øt all the ≈øufferings and ≈øorrows he
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115140:94"/>may meet with here in the world. He that hath a≈ø≈øurance, no ≈øufferings can daunt him. As <hi>Adolphus Clarebachius,</hi> when he was burning at the ≈øtake, he was ≈øo filled with the a≈ø≈øurance of Gods love, that he ≈øaith of him≈øelfe, I think in my heart, there is not a merrier heart in the world, then mine is. And ≈øo another Martyr burning at the ≈øtake ≈øaith, I ta≈øte as much ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe, and finde as much ea≈øe now I am in the flames, as if I lay upon a bed of Ro≈øes. The fulne≈ø≈øe of his joy in the a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods love, made him willingly undergoe any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> was in pri≈øon, till hee was in pri≈øon; <hi>Bainam</hi> ≈øaid, when he was in the fire, I feele no more then if I were in a bed of down. Whereas, thou that harboure≈øt fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øions, thy hopes will ≈øhrink when thou comme≈øt to ≈øuffer, like cloath not well woven, on a rainy day; thy delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions will never beare up thy ≈øpirit to ≈øo high a pitch as the≈øe are. This is thy mi≈øery, thou wilt never have that ≈øweet peace and rejoycing in thy heart Believers have, who are a≈ø≈øured upon Scripture grounds.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, take this for thy dread, that thou wilt be thrown into hell, before thou art aware. It is the ≈øpeech of Mr. <hi>Bolton.</hi> That man that takes up a fal≈øe per≈øwa≈øion of his effectuall Calling, when he is not, he is like unto a man that is in a plea≈øant dream, who dreames he is a King, and hath a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and hath Trea≈øures full of Silver and Gold; yet when he awakes, behold the man hath nothing. He compares him likewi≈øe to a man that is a≈øleep upon the ma≈øt of a ≈øhip; he is in a golden dream, and dreams of Kingdomes, and of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands which he hath, and happily in a moment the wind ari≈øeth, the ≈øhip is to≈ø≈øed upon the waves, &amp; the man is tumbled into the Ocean and drowned. It is ≈øo with many men, who nouri≈øh Golden dreams, and hopes, that heaven is theirs, and Chri≈øt theirs; when as (alas) they are tumbled and thrown into hell, before they are aware. And this ≈øhould be a dreadfull meditation to thy heart, that harboure≈øt pre≈øumptuous per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions of thy effectuall Calling, when thou art not.</p>
               <p>Thus I have done in eleven Sermons with this Doctrine, touching effectuall calling. I pa≈ø≈øe now to the third and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115140:95"/>la≈øt point, drawn from the≈øe words: and that is,</p>

                  <hi>That Chri≈øtians ought to put forth a great deale of diligence to make this ≈øure to their ≈øoules, that they are eternally elected by God to life and ≈øalvation.</hi> Give diligence to make your Calling and election ≈øure.</p>
               <p>There are many profitable points to be handled in the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of this Doctrine; I ≈øhall onely in this remnant of time pro≈øecute a few. And fir≈øt, I ≈øhall ≈øhew you what election is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether a man may be ≈øure of his own election, ≈øeeing election is an act from eternity. How can a man be ≈øure of that which was done in Gods coun≈øell before we had a being? Thirdly, by what di≈øcoveries may a man infallibly judge, that he is elected.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">A. </seg>
                  </label> Which that you may know, I ≈øhall lay down this briefe de≈øcription of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Election is an eternall decree or purpo≈øe of God, whereby he hath freely cho≈øen out of the ma≈ø≈øe of mankind a ≈ømall company of men and women, that ≈øhall come to everla≈øting life and ≈øalvation by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> This is election.</p>
               <p>And here in this de≈øcription there are the≈øe things to be taken notice of. Fir≈øt, I call it an <hi>eternall purpo≈øe;</hi> becau≈øe, though a man be not ju≈øtified from eternity, yet he is elected from eternity. God from eternity had a purpo≈øe that man ≈øhould be ju≈øtified, and ≈øhould be called, and ≈øhould be ≈øaved. Election is from eternity, though vocation, ju≈øtification, and glorification be not ≈øo. Hence you read in Scripture, when it ≈øpeaks of election, Eph. 1.4. <hi>He hath elected us in Chri≈øt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world.</hi> But it is never ≈øaid ≈øo of Ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. God had a purpo≈øe to make us happy, and a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to call us in time, and a purpo≈øe to ju≈øtifie us, from eternity, though the acting of this purpo≈øe is in due time ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. Secondly, I call it <hi>a purpo≈øe, whereby he doth freely chu≈øe.</hi> And this I doe in oppo≈øition to that Papi≈øticall Tenet, that God doth prede≈øtinate or elect men to ≈øalvation upon the fore≈øight of good works. A mo≈øt abominable opinion; and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115140:95"/>takes off the freene≈øs of this act of Gods election, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Not according to our works, but according to his own purpo≈øe &amp; grace:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 1.5.11.</note> ≈øo I ≈øay thirdly, <hi>Whereby God doth freely chu≈øe out of the ma≈ø≈øe of mankind a few to obtaine life and ≈øalvation.</hi> In oppo≈øition to tho≈øe that hold for univer≈øall Redemption, and univer≈øall Grace; As <hi>Origen,</hi> and from him many more have been tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this errour, to hold Election univer≈øall. And ≈øo many of the Papi≈øts: Now the Scripture tels us, that <hi>many are called, but few are cho≈øen.</hi> Election ≈øignifies a choice; now a choice, the very word imports a rejecting of ≈øome, and a culling out of others. The word Election imports, that all ≈øhall not be ≈øaved. <hi>Origen</hi> held this, that all men ≈øhould be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; that Election ≈øhall extend to every man. Yea, the very divels at the day of judgement ≈øhall be ≈øaved: which is an opinion among Chri≈øtians not to be named; for Election belongs but to a few. Fourthly, I ≈øay, that tis to bring them to eternall life and ≈øalvation; therefore called ordination to eternall life, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Q. </seg>2</label> Secondly, Whether may a Chri≈øtian in this life be a≈ø≈øured of his eternall Election; for as much as Election was done in the decree of God, before ever he had a being, or the world was? Therefore ≈øeeing we are not privy to Gods decree and coun≈øell, how can it be ≈øaid, that we may know and be a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of our Eternall Election? Indeed the <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> they beat down this doctrine. And hence it is that in the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> there was this Canon made, that if any man ≈øhould ≈øay he was bound to believe, that he was of the number of them that God hath prede≈øtinate, or elected to life, let him be an accur≈øed man. They did endeavour to beat down a≈ø≈øurance, and held, that all that a man could have, mu≈øt be onely a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturall a≈ø≈øurance, or ≈øome kinde of hopes of ≈øalvation, and no other. Now that you might not erre in this point, ≈øee what the Scripture ≈øpeaks in this ca≈øe. That though Election be an act of God from eternity, yet a believer may firmly and fully know his own election: And this I ≈øhall make good by ≈øeverall places of Scripture. Read <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. <hi>Rejoyce not,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt to his Di≈øciples, <hi>that you have power to ca≈øt out
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115140:96"/>divels, that they are ≈øubject to you, but rejoyce rather in this, that your names are written in the book of life.</hi> That is, rejoyce not, that you can work miracles; that wicked men can doe, that are not elected; but rather rejoyce, that your names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of life; that is, that in Gods decree you are elected to ≈øalvation. Now, how could they rejoyce, unle≈ø≈øe they knew this? So, 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Knowing brethren, beloved, your election of God.</hi> The Apo≈øtle takes it for granted, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers did know they were elected. So <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. <hi>The Lord hath ble≈ø≈øed us with all ≈øpirituall ble≈ø≈øings in Chri≈øt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he hath cho≈øen us in him, before the ≈øoundation of the world was, having prede≈øtinated us to the adoption of children by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> Many more Scriptures I might urge, but in the mouth of two or three witne≈ø≈øes, it is enough to confirme every truth.</p>
               <p>But now though the Scripture be thus cleare; yet there are ≈øome objections, that ≈øeemingly oppo≈øe this truth, which I mu≈øt ≈øatisfie. The <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> as farre as I have read in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, I finde five objections, they draw from Scripture again≈øt this truth, that a man may be a≈ø≈øured of his Election: for, ≈øay they, it was an act of Gods, done before we had a being, and how can we be a≈ø≈øured of that? I will therefore, beloved, fir≈øt produce tho≈øe Scriptures that they pretend wil overthrow this point, and then take off what ≈øeems to make again≈øt it. The fir≈øt Text they urge is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Pa≈ø≈øe the time of your ≈øojourning here in feare.</hi> This Scripture (≈øay they) bids us pa≈ø≈øe our time in feare; and if ≈øo, then we cannot be a≈ø≈øured of our election, but we mu≈øt feare all the daies of our life, whether we are elected or no.</p>
               <p>To this I ≈øhall an≈øwer briefly. You mu≈øt know the feare that the holy Gho≈øt here pre≈ø≈øeth, that men ≈øhould pa≈ø≈øe their time in feare, is not meant of a feare about our election; but it is meant of a feare of ≈øinne; that we mu≈øt not ≈øinne again≈øt God, but feare God, and feare to provoke God by our ≈øinne. And if you ask how this appeares, I make it appeare plainly thus; for ver≈ø. 18. it is ≈øaid, <hi>Knowing beloved, that you are not redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, but with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115140:96"/>blood of Chri≈øt, &amp;c.</hi> Now this ver≈øe proves clearly, that they knew they were redeemed by Chri≈øts bloud, and ≈øo by con≈øequence knew their election. Therefore the Apo≈øtle did not pre≈ø≈øe a feare, to beat down the knowledge of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but, <hi>pa≈ø≈øe your time in feare, i. e.</hi> feare to offend God, and feare to ≈øinne again≈øt him.</p>
               <p>Another objection they urge is this. The Scripture, ≈øay they doth often commend feare to us; and ≈øurely feare and a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance cannot ≈øtand together. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed is the man that feareth alwaies.</hi> Now, if a man mu≈øt alwaies feare, then the mo≈øt a man can have is hope; and ≈øo hang between hope and feare all our daies. To which I an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>That the fearing alwaies, which <hi>Salomon</hi> annexed ble≈ø≈øed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe unto, is not meant of the feare about a mans election, but onely a feare to ≈øinne again≈øt God. And if you ask me how that appeares, read the whole ver≈øe, <hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>≈ø≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>d is the man that feareth alwaies, but he that hardens his heart ≈øhall runne into mi≈øchiefe.</hi> Now mark, by the Antithe≈øis it is apparent, that feare there, is not a feare of our everla≈øting e≈øtate, but onely a feare in oppo≈øition to hardne≈ø≈øe of heart in wicked men, that goe on in a cour≈øe of ≈øin.</p>
               <p>Another place they urge is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Wherefore let him that thinks he ≈øtands, take heed le≈øt he fall.</hi> Now, ≈øay they, the Scripture tells us, that every man, though never ≈øo firm, as he thinks, about his election; yet he mu≈øt take heed, he may fall from grace, and be damned for all this. Now by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to this, I would lay down two things.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, The Apo≈øtle doth not ≈øpeak of men that have a grounded a≈ø≈øurance of their election; but to men that lie in carnall ≈øecurity, and have deluded per≈øwa≈øions of their good e≈øtate; and this appeares by the Text; for he ≈øaith, <hi>let him that</hi> thinks <hi>he ≈øtands.</hi> He doth not ≈øay, <hi>let him that ≈øtands;</hi> for he cannot fall, but <hi>he that thinks he ≈øtands.</hi> Tho≈øe men that nouri≈øh pre≈øumptuous, and ungrounded per≈øwa≈øions, that they are in a good e≈øtate, and in a happy condition, let them take heed, le≈øt they fall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the falling here is not meant a falling away from
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115140:97"/>grace, or a falling away finally after election, for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible; but it is onely meant of a falling into ≈øinne: and ≈øo the meaning is this, <hi>Let him that thinks he ≈øtands,</hi> i. e. that thinks he is ≈øtrong in grace, and ≈øtands upon his own legs, let that man take heed le≈øt he fall into ≈øinne. Now a man may take heed of falling into ≈øinne, yet no way que≈øtion his a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And if you aske how I make it appeare that this is the intendment and ≈øcope of the place; I an≈øwer, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. Read the foregoing ver≈øe, <hi>Let not us tempt Chri≈øt, as they tempted him; let not us murmur, as ≈øome of them murmured, for the≈øe things hapned to them for en≈øamples, and are written for our admonition. Therefore let him that thinketh he ≈øtands, take heed le≈øt he fall.</hi> As much as if he ≈øhould ≈øay, you have here ≈øeen ≈øome men fall into ≈øinne, you have heard ≈øome men murmur, ≈øome men tempt Chri≈øt; this ≈øhould make you affraid, le≈øt you fall into ≈øinne, and ≈øuffer the puni≈øhment they did. But what is this to the denying of a≈ø≈øurance, that men cannot be a≈ø≈øured of their election?</p>
               <p>Another place they urge al≈øo, is <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. <hi>worke out your ≈øalvation with feare and trembling.</hi> Now ≈øay they, if a man mu≈øt work out, and carry on the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of his ≈øalvation with feare and trembling, then ≈øurely a man can never be a≈ø≈øured in this life of his election. To which I an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>That feare and trembling there ≈øpoken of, is not a feare and trembling in oppo≈øition to the a≈ø≈øurance of our election; but in oppo≈øition to that carnall ≈øecurity, and ≈øinfull dependance upon our own ≈øtrength; This is apparent in the next words, <hi>For it is God that worketh in you the will and the deed:</hi> And therefore, becau≈øe you have no ≈øtrength of your own, and no power of your own to doe any thing, therefore feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in that regard.</p>
               <p>Secondly, feare and trembling may very well be con≈øi≈øtent with this grace of a≈ø≈øurance; for we read, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord with trembling.</hi> You may feare, and yet rejoyce al≈øo. So <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 5.7. <hi>As for me, I will come into thy hou≈øe in the multitude of thy mercies, and in thy feare I will wor≈øhip towards thine holy Temple.</hi> Here is feare, and confidence in the mercies
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115140:97"/>of God joyned together; to ≈øhew, that feare and a≈ø≈øurance may very well be con≈øi≈øtent each with other. But then they object, how can this be? for <hi>John</hi> ≈øaith, that <hi>perfect love ca≈øteth out feare.</hi> I an≈øwer, that though <hi>John</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>perfect love ca≈øteth out feare;</hi> yet <hi>John</hi> doth not ≈øay, that imperfect love ca≈øteth out feare. Now in this life our love is imperfect, and therefore mixt with feare; but in heaven our love is perfect, and ≈øo ca≈øts out all feare. So that ≈øtill this makes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt us, but that a man may have a grounded a≈ø≈øurance of his eternall election.</p>
               <p>Another place they object is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Be not high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but feare.</hi> To this I an≈øwer: The≈øe words are not ≈øpoken of fearing our election; that we ≈øhould feare whether we are elected or no. But ≈øerves to beate down any opinion of our own righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, as if we were therefore accepted of God; and to keep us from in≈øulting over the rejected Jewes; now that we are taken in, in their room.</p>
               <p>One Scripture more (whch indeed is the main pillar they re≈øt upon) is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.34. <hi>Who hath known the minde of the Lord? or who hath been his Coun≈øellor?</hi> Here, ≈øay the <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> the Scripture challengeth any man in the world to come forth, and ≈øay, that he knowes Gods mind; by Gods mind is meant Gods decree. And here <hi>Paul</hi> challengeth all, that no man knows the decree of God from eternity. Therefore, if no man knows the mind of God, then certainly none know their own election, for that is Gods mind, and Gods decree: this they hold an undeniable argument.</p>
               <p>And here to ≈øatisfie you in this Scripture, I ≈øhall lay down three things.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, When it is ≈øaid, <hi>No man knows the mind of God; nor no man is his Coun≈øellor:</hi> this doth hold true, that no man knows the mind or decree of the Lord, touching other mens election. The Apo≈øtle doth not ≈øpeak this, as if no man knew Gods minde about his own, but about other mens election, who are elected, and who are not; for that is the ≈øcope of the place. The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they thought all the <hi>Jewes</hi> were damned men; and they cen≈øured and vaunted over them. Now, ≈øaith
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115140:98"/>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> None knows Gods mind concerning others, whether they ≈øhall be ≈øaved or damned, while they are in this world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, no man knows the mind of the Lord in this ≈øen≈øe, that is, ≈øo as to give a rea≈øon of Gods decree; why God did decree this, and decree that; why God did chu≈øe <hi>Peter,</hi> and not elect <hi>Judas;</hi> no man knows the rea≈øon of Gods decree, and of his waies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, No man knows the mind of the Lord, that is, no man knows Gods decree, by looking upon it alone; but by bringing down Gods ≈øecret will to his revealed will; and ≈øo we may know his decree. I may make u≈øe of that place <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Let no man ≈øay, I will a≈øcend up to heaven to fetch Chri≈øt thence; but what ≈øaith the word? the word is night thee, even in thy mouth.</hi> Tru≈øt to that. As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, Let no man think to know Gods decrees, by going into heaven, and there ≈øear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching into Gods decrees, for that he cannot doe; but look upon the word, and there he ≈øhall finde whom God hath ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and decreed to ≈øave, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. No man can know by looking barely upon the decree; but if we compare Gods decree with his word, and from the word look upon them that are elected, we may ea≈øily know whether we are elected or no. Which puts me upon the third head premi≈øed, How a man may be a≈ø≈øured in his own ≈øoule, that he is elected to life and ≈øalvation by God the Father.</p>

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>2 PETER 1.10.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <q>Wherefore the rather, Brethren, give all diligence to make your Calling and Election ≈øure.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN the pro≈øecution of this ≈øubject, you may remember, the la≈øt Doctrine I drew forth was this, <hi>That Chri≈øtians ≈øhould put forth a great deale of diligence to make this ≈øure to their ≈øoules, that they are eternally elected by God the Father.</hi> In the handling of which, I have ≈øhewn you, 1. what election is. 2. That the people of God may make ≈øure their own election, though done from all eternity.</p>
               <p>I come now to ≈øhew you, how the people of God may be a≈ø≈øured in their own hearts that they are eternally elected. And here, to compa≈ø≈øe this knowledge or a≈ø≈øurance of our election, I doe not onely carry it ≈øo farre as the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> doe, that ≈øay, you may have a per≈øwa≈øion, which they call, <hi>fides conjecturalis,</hi> a conjecturall faith, or hope you may be ≈øaved; but will not come up ≈øo farre as the words of my Text, to be ≈øure of it. Now ≈øhould a man u≈øe no more then the words of the Text, in that it is pre≈ø≈øed as a command, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it may be made ≈øure to a mans own ≈øelfe. For no man is bound to an impo≈ø≈øible thing;
<note place="margin">Nemo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netur ad impo≈ø≈øibile.</note> and in that it is a thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to be a≈ø≈øured of our election, the Scripture would never oblige our obedience to that which is impo≈ø≈øible in it ≈øelfe. I doe not drive ≈øo farre onely, but further. What ≈øhould an elect man doe to be certainly per≈øwaded that he is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally elected by God to obtain life and ≈øalvation. I am now handling a doctrine to be trembled at, while you are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it. And in the re≈øolving of this query, you mu≈øt take this rule; that you cannot get a≈ø≈øumnce by a≈øcending into
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115140:99"/>Gods decree, but by de≈øcending into your own hearts, ≈øear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them by the word, whether tho≈øe ≈øaving effects, which God doth work in an elect per≈øon, be wrought in your ≈øoules or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>: and that is the way to come to a ≈øure and certain knowledge of your election. The knowledge of your election is not attainable by a≈øcending into Gods decree; <hi>for who hath made you his Coun≈øellors.</hi> Nor is it enjoyned you by way of Revelation. That is an un≈øure ground, and you may runne into Enthu≈øia≈øme, as well as per≈øwa≈øion about your election. It is not done by Revelation, neither again≈øt nor without the word. What ever te≈øtimony there is, if it come not from the word, you may ≈øu≈øpect it to be a delu≈øion. Now the ≈øafe≈øt way, (though I know much cried down) for you to goe by, in ≈øearching whether you are in the number of Gods elect, is to ≈øearch into your own hearts, whether tho≈øe things be wrought in you, which are wrought in tho≈øe whom God hath elected to life and ≈øalvation. And here I ≈øhall content my ≈øelfe with the naming of ≈øix ≈øaving effects.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, every man that is elected, ≈øooner or latter, ≈øhall be effectually called, and ≈øavingly converted by the power of the word. This the Apo≈øtle laies down, 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Knowing brethren, beloved, your election of God.</hi> How ≈øhould this be known? Ver≈ø. 5. <hi>For our word came not to you in word onely, but in power, and in the holy Gho≈øt:</hi> that is, our Go≈øpel did not come in word onely, to affect your eares, and re≈øt there; but our word came with power, being backt with the operation of the Spirit, for your conver≈øion. This work all men that are elected, ≈øooner or latter mu≈øt come under, to have the power of the word come with authority upon Con≈øcience, for his effectuall calling. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he prede≈øtinated, whom he appointed to life, them he called.</hi> And therefore, Beloved, who ever you are, if you live and die without having the power of the Word to pa≈ø≈øe upon your ≈øoule, for your effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall Calling, you may lay your hearts under this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, that you are not elected by God to obtaine life and ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For, <hi>Whom he hath prede≈øtinated, them he calls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, a man that is elected by God to life, ≈øooner or
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115140:99"/>latter God will ≈øanctifie him by renewing and regenerating grace: And this is onely different from the former in degree; for calling is ≈øanctification begun. Now when God elects a man, he doth not onely begin the work of grace, but he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it on in a cour≈øe of ≈øanctification. And of this you read 2 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>We are bold to give thanks to God alwaies for you, beloved of the Lord, becau≈øe God hath from the beginning cho≈øen you to ≈øalvation, through ≈øanctification of the Spirit, and beliefe of the truth.</hi> If God hath from the beginning cho≈øen a man to ≈øalvation, the Lord doth it through ≈øanctification; not for ≈øanctification, as the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> ≈øay, or for faith for≈øeen, but it is through it, as a means whereby we are brought to ≈øalvation; ≈øanctification ≈øhall runne through your lives, as water through a channel. So, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. They that are <hi>elected according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by Chri≈øt, through ≈øanctification.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. And therefore beloved, if men live and die, and have not the power of ≈øanctifying grace upon their hearts and con≈øciences, and working in their lives, doubtle≈ø≈øe tho≈øe men are not elected; becau≈øe this you ≈øee clearly, that at one time or other God will work this in ≈øuch men. <hi>Jude</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, men elected by God to life and ≈øalvation ≈øhall ≈øoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or latter be brought into a ≈øtate of believing, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternall life believed.</hi> No man that is ordained to eternall life, but ≈øhall be brought to a believing e≈øtate. And therefore men living and dying in a ≈øtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, are not elected. Hence you read, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. it is called, <hi>the faith of Gods elect;</hi> implying, that all that are elected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they die ≈øhall have faith; and none ≈øhall have faith, but onely they; and therefore in a peculiar manner called <hi>the faith of Gods elect,</hi> appropriated onely to them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That man that is elected, ≈øooner, or latter before he dies, God will work in his heart a ≈øpeciall delight in, and an intire love to the word preached. This you have expre≈ø≈øed, <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods word; therefore ye are not of God, becau≈øe you heare not his words.</hi> To be of God, that is, to belong to God by election. Now, he that is of God,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115140:100"/>God will in time make him heare his Word with delight and love; but he that takes no delight therein, is not elected of God. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.5, 6.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Lord will ≈øooner or latter work in the heart of an elect man, love to the people of God, and compa≈ø≈øion to tho≈øe who are not the elect and cho≈øen ones of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Put on as the elect of God, bowels of mercy and loving kindne≈øs.</hi> The Apo≈øtle there by the manner of phra≈øe doth ≈øeem to intimate thus much, <hi>Put on as the elect of God, &amp;c.</hi> As if it were a thing ordained to, and in≈øeparable from an elect man, after his effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling, that he ≈øhould have bowels of mercy towards tho≈øe that are not called, and that he ≈øhould have loving kindne≈ø≈øe towards tho≈øe that are called. For a man that is once elected, and hath the execution of that decree in effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all calling, it is proper to him to have bowels of mercy.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, God will ≈øooner or latter work an elect man into a new cour≈øe of living, and of obedience, from what he had in times pa≈øt. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>You are elected according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God through ≈øanctification to obedience;</hi> that though you were di≈øobedient before, ≈øerving divers lu≈øts, yet God, if he hath cho≈øen you, will bring you into a cour≈øe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>He hath prede≈øtinated us.</hi> What to doe? <hi>that we might be conformable to the image of his Sonne.</hi> God intends, that that per≈øon whom he choo≈øeth to life, ≈øhould be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and that he ≈øhall live another manner of life then before; that though he hath formerly been ≈øubject to ≈øinne and Satan, yet then he ≈øhall walk in waies of obedience to Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Thus having briefly fini≈øht the≈øe heads, I have onely foure or five cautions to lay down, to bound what hath been ≈øaid within the limits of truth. As,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Take notice, that the≈øe ≈øix effects doe not extend to children who die while they are children, but to men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are grown to yeers. A child that cannot act rea≈øon, as he is a child, cannot have any of the≈øe particulars wrought in him, at lea≈øt in that way and manner men of yeeres have. A child, as it is an infant, hath not conver≈øion in that way a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115140:100"/>man hath, though it hath ≈øomewhat equivalent to it; as ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like ≈øanctification, and ≈øomewhat like that faith men of yeeres have; but what that is, and how wrought, man cannot determine. In pre≈ø≈øing of this therefore, I ≈øay, it doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to children who die in their infancy, but onely to men come to yeeres of di≈øcretion, if they live and die without the having of the≈øe ≈øix effects, they may conclude, they cannot be elected.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the want of the≈øe ≈øix particulars for a time, is no Argument of a mans non-election: for before conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion (which is Gods fir≈øt dealing with a ≈øinner) an elect man may be as vile, and as bad as any wicked man alive. As the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.3. <hi>In times pa≈øt we were al≈øo di≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and ≈øerved divers lu≈øts, and lived in plea≈øure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øe, &amp;c.</hi> So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. So that the want of this for a time, is no argument of a mans non-election, for then it would follow, a man unconverted is no elect man, which would cro≈ø≈øe the whole tenour of Scripture: But a man living and dying without the≈øe, doth not belong to the election of grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I doe not pre≈ø≈øe the having of the≈øe effects actually, if you have them habitually. My meaning is this: A man may be elected, and yet may not act any thing an≈øwerable to effectuall calling, nor act with any delight and love to the word, nor act any thing in a way of ≈øanctification; yet, if you have the≈øe habitually, in the habit of them, the≈øe may be te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or evidences of election.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I doe not pre≈ø≈øe the having of the≈øe effects ≈øen≈øibly to be an evidence of election, if ≈øo be you have them really. There are many men have the≈øe really, when they have them not in their own apprehen≈øion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I doe not pre≈ø≈øe the having of the≈øe effects gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ≈øo you have them ≈øincerely. My meaning is this, that a man may be elected; yea, and he may not onely be cho≈øen in Gods eternall decree, but the execution of that decree may be pa≈ø≈øed upon him, that he may be effectually called, and yet he may not have all the≈øe ≈øix effects in a great mea≈øure, in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115140:101"/>the highe≈øt degree, yet he may have them ≈øincerely, and ≈øo be a pledge to his own heart of his eternall election.</p>
               <p>And thus having fini≈øhed this third Query, I come now to enter upon another, depending upon the former; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a very dreadfull ≈øubject, and a point to be trembled at, while it is handling, and that is this: what probable gue≈ø≈øe may be given of a man, that he is not within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election? This is a very high point, and mu≈øt be handled with a great deale of ≈øeriou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øadne≈ø≈øe; it being a point concerning the ≈øalvation or damnation of all the men upon earth. And therfore I would intreat you to look about you. Gods decrees they are in Heaven, and it is onely a reall work of grace upon your hearts on earth, that can give you evidence that tho≈øe decrees are for good to you. As good wrought is an evidence of Gods purpo≈øe to ≈øave you; ≈øo the contrary work may be an evidence of Gods purpo≈øe never to ≈øave you, but of leaving you without the compa≈ø≈øe of his eternall election. There can be nothing laid down ab≈øolutely and certainly, yet there may be many probable gue≈ø≈øes given of the men that are not within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election: Of which I ≈øhall name but ≈øix or ≈øeven ≈øorts. And I wi≈øh to God, that none of you that are before the Lord this day, have your names written in this black book, le≈øt you have ju≈øt cau≈øe to feare your names are not written in the booke of life.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, That man that fals back from a cour≈øe of profe≈ø≈øion to a cour≈øe of prophanene≈ø≈øe, without timely returning; the Scripture gives a ≈øhrewd gue≈ø≈øe of ≈øuch a man, that he is not within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods purpo≈øe to ≈øave. I doe not ≈øay, every back≈øliding, and every decaying affection, but a totall and finall relap≈øe; when a man falls, and ri≈øeth not againe; when a man runs from God, and returns not again; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives a gue≈ø≈øe at him, that he is not within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38, 39. <hi>If any man draw back, my ≈øoule ≈øhall have no plea≈øure in him.</hi> Interpreters ob≈øerve, that in the≈øe words there is a figure, wherein there is le≈ø≈øe expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, then is intended, <hi>My ≈øoule ≈øhall have no plea≈øure in him.</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:115140:101"/>It is as much as if God ≈øhould have ≈øaid, My ≈øoule ≈øhall hate, or I will exceedingly hate him. <hi>But we are not of them that draw back to perdition; but of them that believe, to the ≈øaving of their ≈øoules:</hi> which words clearly import, that men that draw back without returning, they draw back to perdition, to damnation; but we are not of them, ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle. And here then, beloved, doth this word fall upon any man before God this day? Ha≈øt thou left a cour≈øe of ≈øtrictne≈ø≈øe, and fallen into a cour≈øe of prophanene≈ø≈øe and loo≈øene≈ø≈øe? Ha≈øt thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from thy God, and never thinke≈øt of a returning? I ≈øhall not cen≈øure thee now, but if thou live≈øt and die≈øt in this e≈øtate, it is an undoubted argument, thou art not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe of Gods decree to ≈øave.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Men that doe make the mercies and goodne≈ø≈øe of God as arguments to embolden them the more in ≈øinne, ≈øuch men are not likely to be the per≈øons whom God hath elected to life and glory. In the Epi≈øtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> v. 4. It is ≈øpoken there of <hi>men, that turned the grace of God into wantonne≈ø≈øe.</hi> And what ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle of them, <hi>they are men that are ordained of old to condemnation.</hi> The Scripture there makes it the badge of a man ordained of old to condemnation, when he ≈øhal per≈øi≈øt in this ≈øinfull temper, to turn Gods grace into la≈øciviou≈øne≈ø≈øe; that is, to take arguments from the grace, and mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of God, to walk in waies of ≈øinne. And therefore look to it, and with your hearts bewaile it, all you that are apt to abu≈øe doctrines of grace; and becau≈øe God is good, you will be evil; becau≈øe God is mercifull, therefore you will be ≈øinful; if you die in this temper, the Scripture declares, that you are the men ordained of old to condemnation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a man that doth walk in a cour≈øe of ≈øinne, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with malice, and knowingly again≈øt con≈øcience, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinately without reluctancy; and per≈øi≈øt in this, and live and die thus, that man is not within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. There is a phra≈øe, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 59.5. <hi>Be not mercifull, O Lord, unto wicked tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors.</hi> It is in ≈øome tran≈ølations, <hi>Be not mercifull to them that ≈øinne of wicked malice,</hi> or <hi>of malicious wickedne≈ø≈øe.</hi> Now there is this rule which Divines give; that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115140:102"/>tho≈øe prayers which were made by <hi>David,</hi> they are rather Prophecies of what ≈øhould be, then meere prayers that this might be. As <hi>David</hi> prayed again≈øt the Jewes, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 69.22. <hi>that their table might be a ≈ønare to them, and that they ≈øhould alway bow down under their burden:</hi> which was a prophecie, and they did ≈øo. And ≈øo he prayes here, that God <hi>would not be mercifull to men that ≈øinne of wicked malice;</hi> which is as much as a prophecie, that God will not be mercifull to men that ≈øinne of malicious wickedne≈ø≈øe. And therefore, beloved, all you that ≈øo live, and re≈øolve you will die, and haply doe die; who ≈øinne ob≈øtinately, that, let God command what he can, you will do what you plea≈øe; let the Mini≈øter ≈øay what he will, you will doe as you li≈øt; that ≈øinne again≈øt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and again≈øt con≈øcience, and without any reluctancy, re≈øolve to live and die in a cour≈øe of ≈øinne: the Lord be mercifull to ≈øuch per≈øons; for certainly there mu≈øt be no Bible, if ≈øuch men fall within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That man that by living under the powerfull Mini≈øtry of the Word, is more hard in heart, and wor≈øe in life; if a man grows thus, it is an argument, he is not within the purpo≈øe of Gods election. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.14, 15. <hi>By hearing, you ≈øhall heare, but not under≈øtand; by ≈øeeing, you ≈øhall ≈øee, but not perceive; this peoples heart is waxed gro≈ø≈øe, their eares dull in hearing, their eyes ≈øhut, le≈øt at any time they ≈øhould ≈øee with their eyes, heare with their eares, under≈øtand with their hearts, and be converted, and I ≈øhould ≈øave them.</hi> Here is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God laies upon ≈øuch ≈øinners, that they ≈øhall have eyes, and not ≈øee, they ≈øhall be ignorant, their hearts ≈øhall waxe gro≈ø≈øe, they ≈øhall be uncapable of taking any impre≈ø≈øion of the word upon them. And what's the end of all this? le≈øt they ≈øhould be converted, and I ≈øhould ≈øave them; implying, that if God lets you that live under the Mini≈øtry, to have dark eyes, and hard hearts, it is an argument God hath no intent to ≈øave you, and therefore his purpo≈øe is to condemne you. So <hi>John</hi> 12.40. <hi>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their hearts, le≈øt they ≈øhould ≈øee with their eyes, and under≈øtand with their hearts and be converted.</hi> Here it is laid down as an act of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115140:102"/>Gods, that God did harden their hearts, and God did blind their eyes, le≈øt they ≈øhould be converted; Implying, that if men doe live and die, in this temper, that they have lived yeere after yeere under a powerfull Mini≈øtry, and yet they grow more blind in judgement, and more profane in life, and more hard in heart, after 20, 30, 40 yeeres hearing, then they were before; that the word doth but draw out their wickedne≈ø≈øe, and makes them more prophane, and more to oppo≈øe godline≈ø≈øe; the Lord have mercy upon ≈øuch ≈øoules, for certainly if God leave you thus, it is an argument he never intends to ≈øave you; for the Lord doth thus with ≈øuch, that they might not be ≈øaved. There is a pa≈ø≈øage <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>I≈ørael hath not obtained that which he ≈øeeks for, but the election hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the re≈øt were hardned.</hi> By election is meant the elected, (the Ab≈øtract put for the Concrete.) As often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Circumci≈øion put for Circumci≈øed; and ≈øo here, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction put for elected, <hi>The elected have obtained it:</hi> what did they obtaine? they obtained ≈øalvation and glory; <hi>but the re≈øt,</hi> that were not elected, <hi>they were hardned.</hi> The Lord there makes it the badge of them that are not elected, that they are a blinded people, and a hardned people. Intimating, that men that are not elected, they ≈øhall live under the word, yet ≈øhall be blind in mind, ≈øhall be hard in heart, ≈øhall be wicked in life, and the Mini≈øtry of the word ≈øhall never reforme them. And if any of you be ≈øuch, O that the Lord would make you tremble this day, tremble le≈øt you are not in Gods thoughts, to doe you any good another day.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, when God doth give up men to ≈øtrong delu≈øions, not onely to believe lies them≈øelves, but to teach lies to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce others, when the Lord leaves men to live and die in that e≈øtate, the Scripture makes it an argument of them that are not cho≈øen by God to life and glory. You ≈øhall read there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that great delu≈øion of Antichri≈øt, 2 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>God gave them up to ≈øtrong delu≈øions, to believe lies, that all might be damned, that believe not the truth?</hi> It is made a brand of damnation, when God ≈øhall give them over to believe lies. Though a godly man may die in a corrupt opinion, for every
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115140:103"/>errour is not a badge of damnation; but errours that are fundamentall, that ≈øtrike at the foundation of Religion, wherein men runne ≈øo far, as never to repent of their errour; that, the Scripture makes the badge of a man, who≈øe ≈øoule is in a world of danger. Read that Text, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>There were fal≈øe Prophets among the people, like as there ≈øhall be fal≈øe Teachers among you.</hi> And who are they? ver≈ø. 2. <hi>They ≈øhall deny the Lord that bought them, they ≈øhall bring in damnable here≈øies.</hi> (Every errour is not a here≈øie,) but the≈øe men ≈øhall bring in damnable here≈øies, <hi>and many ≈øhall follow their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious waies.</hi> Now what is their cen≈øure? <hi>who≈øe judgement now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation ≈ølumbers not.</hi> Their damnation was not a≈øleep, but for a long time damnation did attend them, and they were in danger of it. So that, beloved, it is great danger for men to be patrons of errour, e≈øpecially when they are gro≈ø≈øe and palpable; and when in Scripture language they may be called damnable here≈øies. It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if men live and die thus, that they are not within the purpo≈øe of Gods Coun≈øell to doe them good.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Men that live and die in a continuall ≈øpurning and oppo≈øition again≈øt the Go≈øpell, and word of God powerfully preached, it is a dreadfull ≈øigne they are not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe of Gods election. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>You are not of God, for you heare not his words.</hi> So <hi>John.</hi> 12. <hi>He that heareth the word, is of God, but you heare not his word, therefore you are not of God.</hi> Therefore you belong not to him. But more pregnant to this purpo≈øe, is that place, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46, 47, 48. <hi>It was nece≈ø≈øary the word of the Lord ≈øhould fir≈øt have been ≈øpoken to you, but ≈øeeing you put it from you, and judge your ≈øelves unworthy of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> Now compare this with Ver≈ø. 48. <hi>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternall life, believed.</hi> The oppo≈øition lies thus: As many as God purpo≈øed to ≈øave, they glorified God for his word, and they rejoyced, and were glad in his word: but tho≈øe that were not decreed to ≈øalvation, they put off from them the word of the Lord, they ≈øpurned at it, and oppo≈øed it, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115140:103"/>could not indure the word of the Lord. Therefore the Text ≈øaith, <hi>The Jewes ≈øtirred up the devout and honourable women, and they rai≈øed up per≈øecution again≈øt Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coa≈øt.</hi> It was ≈øaid to <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 25.16. <hi>By this I know, that the Lord hath purpo≈øed to de≈øtroy thee, becau≈øe thou ha≈øt not hearkned to my coun≈øell.</hi> Thus you ≈øee, the Scripture makes it the badge of a man, that doth not fall within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election, to bring him to life and glory, to live and die in oppo≈øition to the word of God.</p>
               <p>Sevently, and this we may ≈øpeake more confidently and po≈øitively, that that man is not within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election, who ≈øinnes the ≈øinne again≈øt the holy Gho≈øt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. <hi>He ≈øhall neither be forgiven in this life, nor in the life to come.</hi> This is an unpardonable ≈øinne, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. Now I know there are many men, who confine this ≈øinne onely to the Phari≈øees, as if they onely were guilty of it. There are others, that ≈øay this ≈øinne is ≈øeldome committed; and ≈øo many Divines ≈øpeak favourably of it: but, Beloved, I am per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, this ≈øinne is oftner committed, then mo≈øt men in the world dream of; and many men are plunged into this ≈øinne, that think well of their own ≈øoules. The ≈øinne again≈øt the holy Gho≈øt, is onely this.</p>
               <p>It is a wilfull and deliberate act in a profe≈ø≈øor of Religion, whereby he doth not onely fall from his profe≈ø≈øion; but he runnes into a cour≈øe of ≈øinne knowingly, again≈øt con≈øcience; ob≈øtinately, again≈øt coun≈øell; and maliciou≈øly, again≈øt Je≈øus Chri≈øt. This is briefly a de≈øcription of this ≈øinne. Now I am per≈øwaded there are many in the world that have profe≈ø≈øed Religion, that are, if not in this ≈øinne, yet at the very next doore to it. And if a man be gone thus farre, this is called in Scripture, <hi>a ≈øinne unto death;</hi> a ≈øinne, which if a man fall into, he may be ≈øure he ≈øhall be damned. And thus I have in briefe given you an account of the≈øe ≈øeven particulars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every man may give a gue≈ø≈øe in his own thoughts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be within the purpo≈øe of Gods election to ≈øalvation, or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:115140:104"/>I have now, from this ≈øad Doctrine, onely a few comfortable po≈øitions to lay down, and ≈øo conclude. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though the≈øe particulars may give you a gue≈ø≈øe of tho≈øe that are not within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election, yet no man is bound to make this ≈øure to him≈øelfe, that he is not elected. You are bound to make your election ≈øure, but you are not bound to make your reprobation ≈øure. For the≈øe heads I have given out, not to make any godly man que≈øtion his election, but to ≈øtartle wicked men, who live quite contrary, and oppo≈øite to the elect of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That a man may come very nigh to the wor≈øt of the≈øe ≈øins, and yet may be an elect man. <hi>We were</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>≈øometimes di≈øobedient, deceived, and ≈øerved divers lu≈øts.</hi> Titus 3.3. And Ephe≈ø. 2.2. <hi>In times pa≈øt you walked according to the cour≈øe of the world, according to the power of the Prince of the aire, who worketh mightily in the children of di≈øobedience.</hi> In times pa≈øt you were children of wrath, as well as others. In times pa≈øt before calling, you may come very neere to the≈øe evils, yet be within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you doe not live and die in tho≈øe evils. For if ≈øo, there is no hope of mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That for men to que≈øtion their election, meerly becau≈øe they doe not finde the ≈øaving effects of election in their hearts and lives, is rather an argument of their being, then of their not being elected. Becau≈øe men not elected, they never look after their election, to make it ≈øure, they will tru≈øt all upon the mercy of God, and grace of God, and never look after holine≈ø≈øe; ≈øin never troubles them, profanene≈ø≈øe never grieves them, want of holine≈ø≈øe perplexes not them. The que≈øtioning therefore of your election ari≈øing from the evils of your conver≈øation, is rather a ≈øigne that God hath cho≈øen you to life and glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Election it runnes often times to tho≈øe, that are the wor≈øt ≈øort of men in the world. Election runnes to them that have been wor≈øt in their lives, before they were called. And thereby God magnifies the riches of his grace. Election pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth by civill hone≈øt men, and ingenious tempered men, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115140:104"/>commonly runs to men, that have been ≈øcandalous, loo≈øe, Athei≈øticall, profane livers, before they were called. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31. <hi>Whores and Harlots ≈øhall come to Heaven before you. Mana≈ø≈øeh,</hi> that was a cruell murderer, and Idolater, yet election ran to him. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> a common ≈øtrumpet, out of whom Chri≈øt ca≈øt ≈øeven Divels, yet election ran to her. <hi>Rahab,</hi> a Harlot; <hi>Paul,</hi> a per≈øecuter, a bla≈øphemer, a man injurious to the Saints; yet <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15. <hi>He was a cho≈øen ve≈ø≈øell unto God,</hi> and obtained mercy. God, to magnifie the riches of his free grace, lets election run to the wor≈øt of men that are in the world. And this ≈øhould be great comfort to you; though you have been drunkards, and though you have been Sabbath breakers and adulterers, and though you have been profane, yet if you can but now clo≈øe in with Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and looke after heaven, if you can but now mourn over your condition, and repent of your former failings, and come in to Je≈øus Chri≈øt; Election hath runne unto men as bad as you, and though you may be now men profane in your lives, yet you may be objects of Gods election.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THe la≈øt Doctrine I drew from the≈øe words, was this, <hi>That Chri≈øtians ≈øhould put forth a great deale of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make this ≈øure to their ≈øoules, that they are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally elected by God to life and glory.</hi> In the pro≈øecution of which, I have gone over ≈øome queries. There are four diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties or queries I am further to in≈øi≈øt upon in treating of this point. As namely,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, whether this election be univer≈øall, or no?</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether a man that is once elected by God to ≈øalvation, may come to be damned, yea, or no?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whether God, in electing a man to life and glory, doth it out of any fore≈øight of faith, or any other grace he ≈øees in man?</p>
               <p>And fourthly, whether this doctrine of election, that God in his own coun≈øell hath determined, who ≈øhall be damned, and who ≈øaved, doth not take men off from any endeavours after their own ≈øalvation, to make them de≈øperate, and neglect the u≈øe of means; that they ≈øhall ≈øay, if I ≈øhall be damned, I ≈øhall be damned; and if ≈øaved, I ≈øhall be ≈øaved, let me live as I li≈øt? whether this doctrine will favour this de≈øperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion, yea, or no?</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, whether election be univer≈øall, or no? This is that the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> doe mightily drive at. And here they lay down this conclu≈øion, which they make unque≈øtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: That there is ≈øuch a thing as a certain univer≈øall election of God, without limitation or re≈øtraint of per≈øons, whereby
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115140:105"/>God did determine to ≈øave all mankind by Chri≈øt, who were fallen in <hi>Adam.</hi> This opinion was fir≈øt drawn from <hi>Origen,</hi> who held that all creatures ≈øhould be ≈øaved; and the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> mincing the matter, to make it a little more plau≈øible, then he did, they ≈øay, that God in his purpo≈øe did intend to ≈øave all mankind by Je≈øus Chri≈øt; but man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away, and walking contrary to their principles, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect lies in them, that they are not ≈øaved: and this Divines call univer≈øall redemption.</p>
               <p>Now again≈øt this, I ≈øhall lay down ≈øeverall Scriptures, and then take off the objections that ≈øeems to ≈øtrengthen this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, for Scriptures. In the Epi≈øtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> ver≈ø. 3. you read of <hi>≈øome that were ordained of old to condemnation.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øure all could not be ≈øaved. 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Some men are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to wrath, but we to obtain ≈øalvation through Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> Therefore all men could not be within the purpo≈øe of Gods fir≈øt intention to ≈øave. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Many are called, but few are cho≈øen.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>The Jewes did not obtaine what they ≈øought for, but the elect obtained it, and the re≈øt were hardned.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.20. <hi>There are ve≈ø≈øels of honour, and ve≈ø≈øels of di≈øhonour.</hi> The Scripture makes it a di≈øcriminating act in God, that ≈øome he cho≈øe to life; and others from eternity in his councell he cho≈øe to wrath and condemnation. And the≈øe Scriptures will fully overthrow this opinion. And indeed the very word <hi>chu≈øing</hi> confutes it, which intimates a taking of ≈øome, with an overlooking of others.</p>
               <p>But now let us view a little the Arguments or Scriptures they abu≈øe, to ≈øtrengthen this un≈øound opinion of theirs.</p>
               <p>One is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>As in Adant all died, even ≈øo in Chri≈øt ≈øhall all be made alive.</hi> Now, ≈øay they, Every man did die in <hi>Adam;</hi> every mothers child by <hi>Adams</hi> fall became ≈øubject to death: even ≈øo, in Chri≈øt ≈øhall every man be made alive; the Lord did intend that every man ≈øhould have benefit by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Now to take off this; I ≈øhall an≈øwer it in ≈øhewing you the true intent and ≈øcope of this Scripture. This univer≈øall phra≈øe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115140:106"/>of making alive, hath not reference to the ≈øaving of the ≈øoule, but to the re≈øurrection of the body: And ≈øo the ≈øence is this. That as in <hi>Adam,</hi> by vertue of his ≈øinne, every man came to die a naturall death; So in Chri≈øt ≈øhall all be made alive; that is, ≈øo by Chri≈øts power ≈øhall every man ri≈øe from the dead. And if you aske how I make that appeare to be the intendment of the Text. I an≈øwer, the words them≈øelves will make it plaine. Ver≈ø. 11. It is ≈øaid, <hi>By man came death, by man al≈øo came the re≈øurrection from the dead:</hi> that is, as by that man <hi>Adam</hi> came death, ≈øo by that man Chri≈øt ≈øhall come the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection from the dead: <hi>for as in Adam all died,</hi> &amp;c. ≈øo that here you ≈øee, this is brought in as a proofe of the 21. ver≈øe: Intimating, that this being made alive, hath no reference to the life of the ≈øoule, but onely to the Re≈øurrection of the body; that as <hi>Adam</hi> by his ≈øinne brought death to all men, ≈øo Chri≈øt by his power ≈øhall rai≈øe all men from the dead; <hi>every man in his own order.</hi> However, ≈øhould this be granted, that this making alive ≈øhould have reference to the life of the ≈øoul; it would beare no more but this, that all that are damned, are damned as in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes; and all that are ≈øaved, ≈øhall be ≈øaved as in the loynes of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And ≈øo make nothing at all to prove this which they call univer≈øall election.</p>
               <p>Another Scripture (undeniable they think) is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. where it is ≈øaid, <hi>God hath concluded all men under unbeliefe, that he might have mercy upon all.</hi> Now ≈øay they, If God did doe an act to make men ≈øee their unbeliefe, and did intend by this action to have mercy upon all, then God in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell intended to ≈øave all.</p>
               <p>Now to this, <hi>that he might have mercy upon all;</hi> I an≈øwer: This phra≈øe (<hi>all</hi>) is not to be taken in an unlimited ≈øence, as if he would have mercy upon all mankind; but it is to be taken in a re≈øtrained ≈øence, that <hi>God ≈øhut up all men in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe;</hi> that is, God made all believers ≈øee their own mi≈øery; that he might have mercy on all them that believe. And if you ask how I prove this to be the meaning of the Text, I an≈øwer: The Scripture makes it cleare, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath concluded all men under ≈øinne.</hi> (The very words fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted.)
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115140:106"/>But what's the limitation? Shall all men be ≈øaved? No. For mark the next words. <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all men under ≈øinne, that the promi≈øe by the faith of Je≈øus Chri≈øt ≈øhould be given to them that believe.</hi> Now, though <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ≈øay thus to the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet the words being the ≈øame, the Re≈øtriction holds good in both places. So that it is clear, <hi>That he might ≈øave all,</hi> or <hi>have mercy upon all.</hi> It is not meant all univer≈øally; but all, with this limitation of <hi>Paul</hi> here; all <hi>them that believe.</hi> Again,</p>
               <p>Another objection, or Scripture, they abu≈øe is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Who will have all men to be ≈øaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> This Text <hi>Origen</hi> doth gro≈øly abu≈øe; holding hence, that it is the intendment and will of God, that all men ≈øhould be ≈øaved. Now, to take off this objection; We mu≈øt fir≈øt di≈øtingui≈øh here of Gods will, and then of this phra≈øe, <hi>All. Who will have all men to be ≈øaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, of Gods will;

                     </gap>placiti &amp; volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas ≈øigni.</note> and the Schoolmen give this di≈øtinction about it. That there is a will of Gods good plea≈øure; and there is Gods ≈øignifying will.</p>
               <p>Now the will of Gods good plea≈øure is, that reall purpo≈øe in God to ≈øave a man. And there is no man that in this ≈øence God wils to be ≈øaved, but he mu≈øt be ≈øaved; but in this ≈øence God wils not all men to be ≈øaved.</p>
               <p>But ≈øecondly, there is Gods ≈øignificative will, that is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in Scripture God tenders ≈øalvation to every man that will lay hold upon Je≈øus Chri≈øt: and ≈øo Gods ≈øignifying will excludes no man from ≈øalvation; but the Mini≈øters, if they preach to ten thou≈øand people, they mu≈øt tender Chri≈øt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øally to them all, becau≈øe they know not which of them are elect, and which reprobate; which of them ≈øhall be ≈øaved, and which damned. This is Gods ≈øignifying will, and though God by this will tell you what Mini≈øters mu≈øt doe, to tender Chri≈øt and ≈øalvation to all; yet this doth no way follow, that the determinate will of Gods good plea≈øure is involved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, as if all men ≈øhould be ≈øaved. <hi>Perkins</hi> in his writings hath this di≈øtinction of it. That there is Gods ab≈øolute will, and ≈øo he wils not all men to be ≈øaved: and Gods condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115140:107"/>will, that in ca≈øe every man did believe, they ≈øhould be ≈øaved; for God envies no mans ≈øalvation; there is grace enough in God, and willingne≈ø≈øe enough in God, to ≈øave every man in the world.</p>
               <p>But ≈øecondly, there may be a more di≈øtinct an≈øwer given to this place. <hi>God will have all men to be ≈øaved. All,</hi> is taken ≈øometimes in a di≈øtributive ≈øence, and ≈øometimes in a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective ≈øence. In a di≈øtributive ≈øence, for every man under heaven; and ≈øo God wils not all men to be ≈øaved. But ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in a collective ≈øence; for all ≈øorts and degrees of men, and ≈øo God intends to ≈øave all; that is, ≈øome of all ≈øorts, and of all degrees of men in the world. And this appeares if you mark the context. <hi>He will have all men to be ≈øaved,</hi> that is, ≈øome of all ≈øorts. Some Kings, and ≈øome great men, ≈øome rich, and ≈øome poore, ≈øome Princes, and ≈øome beggars. And therefore the Apo≈øtle bids them pray for all men. <hi>Pray,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>for Kings, and for them in authority: for God will have all men to be ≈øaved.</hi> As much as if he ≈øhould ≈øay, Pray for Kings, becau≈øe God of his grace may ≈øave Kings, as well as poorer men, that have le≈ø≈øe incumbrances, and le≈ø≈øe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world, and le≈ø≈øe withdrawings in their own ≈øoule, then they have. God will ≈øave all: ≈øalvation ≈øhall come to all ≈øorts of men, and therefore you may lawfully pray for them. And ≈øo <hi>Calvin</hi> judiciou≈øly expounds this place; that God will have all ≈øorts of men to obtaine ≈øalvation by Je≈øus Chri≈øt: but is not to be extended univer≈øally, as if every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall man and woman ≈øhould be ≈øaved. 3. The≈øe words are to be taken with tho≈øe that follow after, <hi>God will have all men to be ≈øaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Now that God will be willing to ≈øave tho≈øe that come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, is unque≈øtionable; all that repent, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. all oppo≈øition to the time of the old Te≈øtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Q. </seg>
                  </label> Whether may a man that is elected fall away, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peri≈øh? To this I an≈øwer. No. A man that is once ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by God can never peri≈øh. And this I ≈øhall give Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and rea≈øon to plead for it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. Chri≈øt tels us of errour, that it came in ≈øo ea≈øily, <hi>that if it were po≈ø≈øible, it would deceive the elect.</hi> Intimating, that it is impo≈ø≈øible ≈øo to ≈øeduce the elect, as to make them finally fall away. So, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given me, ≈øhall come unto me:</hi> that is, all that God the Father hath decreed to ≈øave by Chri≈øt, ≈øhall come unto Chri≈øt. Ver≈ø. 39. <hi>This is the Fathers will, that hath ≈øent me, that of all that he hath given me, I ≈øhould lo≈øe none.</hi> This is the Fathers will, and Commi≈ø≈øion to Chri≈øt, that of all tho≈øe that by his decree he had given to Chri≈øt to ≈øave by redemption, he ≈øhould lo≈øe none. And ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>I have lo≈øt nothing.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> 10.28, 29. <hi>I give unto my ≈øheep eternall life, and they ≈øhall never peri≈øh, neither ≈øhall any man take them out of my hands; my Father that gave them me, is greater then all, and no man ≈øhall pluck them out of my Fathers hands.</hi> By his Fathers hands, he means his decree; God by his decree intended to ≈øave ≈øo many, and Chri≈øt to vindicate his Father, tels us, that ≈øo many as God the Father had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to ≈øalvation, neither man nor divell ≈øhould prevaile to pluck them out of his Fathers hand. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1. <hi>God hath
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115140:108"/>not ca≈øt away his people whom he ≈øoreknew.</hi> That is, whom God did prede≈øtinate, he ca≈øts none of them away, none of them ≈øhall peri≈øh. Many more Scriptures I might multiply, to ≈øhew, that a man once elected, can never peri≈øh; as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 9. 2 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 3.3. But I would name rea≈øons as well as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, if Election were changeable, then God mu≈øt be changeable; which to think, there is nothing more ab≈øurd. If Gods decree be changeable, Gods e≈ø≈øence and nature were ≈øo al≈øo; election being nothing el≈øe, but God him≈øelfe chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing: for every thing in God, is God. And this the Scripture tels us, is farre from him; for <hi>there is no variablene≈ø≈øe or ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of change in God. Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 46.10. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the elect could peri≈øh, then Je≈øus Chri≈øt ≈øhould be very unfaithfull to his father, becau≈øe God the father hath given this charge to Chri≈øt, that whom≈øoever he elected, Chri≈øt ≈øhould pre≈øerve them ≈øafe, to bring them to heaven. Now ≈øhould not this be accompli≈øhed, Chri≈øt would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull to his father. <hi>John</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the fathers will, which hath ≈øent me into the world, that of all that he hath given me, I ≈øhould lo≈øe nothing, but that I ≈øhould rai≈øe them up at the la≈øt day.</hi> This is the will of God, to ≈øave many by Chri≈øt. Now, ≈øhould not this be made good, Chri≈øt mu≈øt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull to the Commi≈ø≈øion of his father.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ≈øhould this be true, then <hi>Pauls</hi> golden chaine ≈øhould be broken. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he did prede≈øtinate, them he calls; whom he calls, them he ju≈øtifies; whom he ju≈øtifies, them he glorifies.</hi> Now, ≈øhould this chain break, that whom he elects, them he calls, whom he calls, them he ju≈øtifies, and there cea≈øe (as the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> hold) and men be after damned, then the great and many links would be lo≈øt, that whom he ju≈øtifies, them he glorifies, and ≈øo bring an ab≈øurdity upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereby.</p>
               <p>Now to an≈øwer ≈øome texts of Scripture they abu≈øe, (which at fir≈øt view you would think very plau≈øible) to maintain, that a man may be an elect man, and brought into Chri≈øt, yet afterward damned. The fir≈øt is, <hi>John</hi> 6.70. <hi>Have not I cho≈øen
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115140:108"/>twelve, and one of them is a divell?</hi> Now ≈øay they, there were twelve cho≈øen, or elected, and one of them is a divel, did peri≈øh, intimating, that men may be elected, yet peri≈øh for all this. To which I an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>That there is a double electing. Fir≈øt, a chu≈øing to ≈øome peculiar Office. Secondly, there is an electing to grace, life, and glory. Now, when Chri≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>Have not I cho≈øen you twelve?</hi> it is meant of his chu≈øing of them to an Office, to the place of an Apo≈øtle, to be his di≈øciples. Now it is true, that man may be cho≈øen to ≈øome peculiar office in the Church of God, and yet be a peri≈øhing and damned man; but this phra≈øe hath no relation to the decree of God from eternity, onely to a temporall electing of twelve men to a temporall Office, to the Office of an Apo≈øtle.</p>
               <p>Another Scripture they abu≈øe is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32. it was <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> prayer, <hi>If thou wilt not</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to God) <hi>forgive their ≈øinnes, then blot my name out of the book of life.</hi> Now, ≈øay they, <hi>the book of life</hi> is Gods election: and here <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> prayed, <hi>that God would blot his name out of the book of life.</hi> Intimating, ≈øay they, a man may be elected and written in that book, and yet afterward blotted out and peri≈øh?</p>
               <p>To which I an≈øwer. That this prayer of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> is onely a wi≈øh or ≈øuppo≈øition, as <hi>Pauls</hi> was, when he wi≈øht <hi>he were accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed from Chri≈øt, for his kindred in the fle≈øh.</hi> Now a man may ≈øuppo≈øe mountaines of Gold, and ≈øuppo≈øe things that never were, nor ever ≈øhall be in being: bare ≈øuppo≈øitions put nothing in being; ≈øo here, that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> makes a ≈øuppo≈øition in a pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall prayer; this doth no way argue, as if his name could be blotted out of the book of life.</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>Rivet</hi> he expounds it thus, that there is a double book of life. The book of life being ≈øometimes taken for the eternall coun≈øell and decree of God, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3. ≈øometimes for the ≈øpeciall providence of God over men, in pre≈øerving them among the living. So we read <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 139. <hi>In thy book,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>David, were all my members written:</hi> meaning, not in the book of Gods decree, but onely in the book of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that all the members of <hi>Davids</hi> body, they were all
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115140:109"/>under the providence of God, that none could hurt him. And ≈øo <hi>Rivet,</hi> with others, think that by the book of life here is meant, that God would blot out <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> from the book of his ≈øpeciall protection, and let him die as other men, rather then this evil ≈øhould come upon the people of <hi>I≈ørael. q. d.</hi> De≈øtroy my name from among men, and doe not protect me any longer.</p>
               <p>Againe, they object that in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 69.28. It is ≈øaid, <hi>Let them be blotted out of the book of life.</hi> Now, ≈øay they, That is Gods election, and to be blotted out implies, that a man may be elected, and yet peri≈øh.</p>
               <p>To this I an≈øwer, as formerly, that the book of life in that place hath no reference to the decree of Gods election, but onely to his book of providence, that God would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect wicked men, as he doth his own people, in a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. And other phra≈øes in Scripture will ≈øomewhat fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this interpretation. As <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.9. <hi>They ≈øhall not be written in the writings of the hou≈øe of I≈ørael.</hi> Whats that? <hi>i.e.</hi> let them not any more be thought I≈øraelites, nor numbred among the people. And <hi>Ain≈øworth,</hi> I remember compares <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 69.19. with this place in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.9. and he makes the ≈øence to be one and the ≈øame; that to be blotted out of the book of life, is nothing el≈øe, then to be out of Gods protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to be blotted out of the catalogue of the living, and have ones life in danger to be brought to death. And this wi≈øh <hi>David</hi> wi≈øhed for tho≈øe wicked men.</p>
               <p>But then they object further from <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.19. <hi>If any man ≈øhall take away from the words of this book, God ≈øhall take away his part in the book of life.</hi> Here, ≈øay they, by book of life, is unque≈øtionably meant, Gods decree; and the Scripture ≈øaith, <hi>they that take any thing from this booke, God will blot him out of the book of life,</hi> and will undoubtedly damne him.</p>
               <p>To which I an≈øwer. I confe≈ø≈øe in this place the book of life is taken for Gods decree; and that a man may be ≈øaid to be blotted out of this book, and yet this no way follow, that a man elected may be damned. And here, let me give you <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtins</hi> words upon the place, which is a very cleare and ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory an≈øwer. That a man may be ≈øaid to be blotted out of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115140:109"/>the book of life in two regards: Fir≈øt, it is equivalent to this phra≈øe, that his name ≈øhall never be written in the book of life. And you have often ≈øuch phra≈øes in Scripture. As it is ≈øaid in <hi>Matthew. He that doth evill him≈øelfe, and teacheth men ≈øo to doe, he ≈øhall be lea≈øt in the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not as if he ≈øhould come to heaven, but that he ≈øhould not come there at all. To be lea≈øt there, is never to be there. So here, To be blotted out is equivalent to this, that they were never in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a mans name may be ≈øaid to be blotted out of the book of life, not as if it were there in deed and in truth, but in their own opinion; they thought they were elected, and thought their names were written there, they had ≈øtrong conceits of this; and though they are now deluded, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtaken, yet God will make them know one day, when they are in hell, that their names are blotted out of the book of life. Again,</p>
               <p>Another Scripture they abu≈øe is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Let him that thinks he ≈øtands, take heed le≈øt he fall.</hi> Now, ≈øay they, if it were not po≈ø≈øible for a man elected to fall, and fall finally, to what end is this caution of the Apo≈øtle? it were a needle≈ø≈øe caution, were it not po≈ø≈øible to come to pa≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>To which I an≈øwer two things. Fir≈øt, the Apo≈øtle doth not ≈øay, Let him that ≈øtands, take heed le≈øt, &amp;c. but the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>Let him that thinks he ≈øtands, take heed le≈øt he fall.</hi> Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that men that think they are elected, and think they are in a good condition, they ≈øhould take heed, le≈øt they mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed le≈øt they fall.</hi> This falling here is not meant, a falling from grace finally, and falling into hell, and peri≈øhing; but the falling here is onely a falling into ≈øinne, and ≈øo an elect man ≈øhould doe. An elect man, though he ≈øtand firm in Gods decree, yet he ≈øhould take heed all the daies of his life, that he fall not into ≈øinne. And if you aske me, how I make that appeare, I an≈øwer, from the context. This is a conclu≈øion, or caution the Apo≈øtle gives upon the enumeration of ≈øeverall in≈øtances of the people of God, that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115140:110"/>in former ages did ≈øinne again≈øt God. <hi>As ≈øome that tempted Chri≈øt, and ≈øell in one day</hi> 23000. <hi>Others that fell to fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and provoked him in the wilderne≈ø≈øe.</hi> With many ≈øuch ≈øins reckoned up, and the ≈øumme of all is this, that ≈øeeing they that were Gods people fell into ≈øinne, and were puni≈øhed, therefore you that think you ≈øtand, and think you are elected, you ≈øhould take heed you fall not into ≈øinne, as they did. And thus I have done with re≈øolving this ≈øecond query.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whether doth God elect any man to life and ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon fore≈øight of his faith or good works? fore≈øeeing that this man will believe, therefore I elect him to ≈øalvation; and the other man doth not believe, therefore I chu≈øe him to damnation. Whether, I ≈øay, doth God in his eternall decree elect any man to life, upon fore≈øight of works. Here the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> joyne both together in maintaining of this. The rea≈øon, ≈øay they, why God elects ≈øome, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is becau≈øe God did fore≈øee from eternity that that man would be holy, and would believe in Chri≈øt, and therefore God elected him to ≈øalvation. The≈øe are the hard imputations they lay to Gods charge.</p>
               <p>And in the re≈øolving of this, I ≈øhall an≈øwer it in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. That God, in electing a certain number of men to life and ≈øalvation, did not doe it upon the fore≈øight of any good works he ≈øaw would be in them; whether Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ≈øanctification, or any other grace. Indeed it is true, the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> many of them doe not gro≈øly ≈øay, that it was fore≈øight of good works in generall, but the fore≈øight of faith only, and ≈øo the <hi>Arminians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, to overthrow this ungrounded opinion, Fir≈øt, I ≈øhall lay down Scriptures to confirm this, that God in electing of men to ≈øalvation, doth not doe it upon fore≈øight of good workes, and then lay down rea≈øons; and after that take tho≈øe objections, which ≈øeem to darken this truth.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, for the Scriptures that confirm this, we have <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>He hath ≈øaved a remnant according to the election of grace.</hi> Intimating, that the remnant that are ≈øaved, it is onely of grace, not of fore≈øeen works. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 11. <hi>He hath elected
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115140:110"/>us according to the good plea≈øure of his own will.</hi> Gods meere good will was the impul≈øive cau≈øe of mans election, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in man. So likewi≈øe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>That Gods election might ≈øtand, not according to our works, but according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of him that called us.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Not of works, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own purpo≈øe and grace.</hi> Upon his good plea≈øure, and his good will to mankind, upon that ground election ≈øtands.</p>
               <p>But now to adde ≈øome rea≈øons, why it cannot be that God ≈øhould determine in his own coun≈øell, to ≈øave man upon the fore≈øight of his works. I ≈øhall name three or foure. As,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, becau≈øe the inferiour priviledges that God be≈øtows upon his people, as vocation, and ju≈øtification (though they are in actuall being) are not for their good works, therefore much le≈ø≈øe is election for good works onely fore≈øeen. Fir≈øt, for Vocation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We are called, not according to our own works, but according to the purpo≈øe of his own grace.</hi> And then for ju≈øtification, we are not ju≈øtified for works neither. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.34. <hi>We are ju≈øtified freely by his grace, for by the works of the law ≈øhall no fle≈øh be ju≈øtified.</hi> Now, if vocation and ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication be not for works, much le≈ø≈øe is election for works, and for works fore≈øeen, not in being in us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becau≈øe then it would follow, that children, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in infancy could not be elected<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> for the child being in the mothers wombe, if it hath life, it hath a ≈øoule, and ≈øo mu≈øt either be ≈øaved, or damned. But a child, while it is in the womb, neither acts good or evill. Now if God did elect per≈øons to life, upon fore≈øight of works, then children dying in the wombe could not be elected; becau≈øe there are no works God could fore≈øee in them. And then this would be a very uncomfortable doctrine for parents, that have children dying young.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, then would man have ≈øomewhat whereof to boa≈øt before his God, as if he could lay claime to ≈øalvation from him. If God were bound to choo≈øe men to ≈øalvation upon fore≈øight of good works, then man might ≈øay, I thank not God, but I thank my believing, and thank my good works,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115140:111"/>for the≈øe were the motives for which he cho≈øe me to glory; and thus would poore man boa≈øt again≈øt his Maker.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becau≈øe God hath elected the wor≈øt of men; when others that have more naturall worth and goodne≈ø≈øe are pa≈ø≈øed by. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28. <hi>God hath cho≈øen the fooli≈øh things of the world to confound the wi≈øe, and God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen the weake things of the world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ba≈øe things of the world, and things that are de≈øpi≈øed hath God cho≈øen, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, that thou ha≈øt hid the≈øe things from the wi≈øe and prudent, and ha≈øt revealed them unto babes.</hi> Tho≈øe that had the greate≈øt worldly wi≈ødome, and naturall abilities, that mo≈øt excelled in outward ≈øtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and morall vertues, are rejected, when tho≈øe that are but babes in under≈øtanding, who many times are the wor≈øt for their moralities, are elected; which is a cleare demon≈øtration, that election is not grounded upon faith, or works fore≈øeen; for then the be≈øt had been cho≈øen before the re≈øt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Our works carry no proportion to what God hath elected us unto; we are elected to eternall glory, but our works are finite, imperfect, no more then our duty; yea not done by our own ≈øtrength, but by the power of Gods grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be that which moveth God to elect us.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, becau≈øe God doth not chu≈øe men to life for the ≈øake of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, therefore much le≈ø≈øe for their works ≈øake.</p>
               <p>It is true, and mi≈øtake me not, I confe≈ø≈øe, (and ≈øo all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that are confe≈ø≈øe this) that God ≈øaves a man for Chri≈øts ≈øake, but God elects not a man for Chri≈øts ≈øake, but meerly for his own good plea≈øures ≈øake. God in chu≈øing a man to life, hath no reference to Chri≈øt, as if Chri≈øt were the motive. Chri≈øt was prede≈øtinated him≈øelfe, therefore could not be the cau≈øe of our prede≈øtination, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. We are cho≈øen in him its true, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. as the common per≈øon; God elected Chri≈øt fir≈øt in order, and all believers in him, but it is not for Chri≈øts ≈øake, but according to his own will. As ≈øuppo≈øe a Kingdome to be newly ≈øet up, a King is cho≈øen, and his ≈øucce≈ø≈øors to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after; why then all the ≈øucceeding Kings are cho≈øen in him that was fir≈øt elected: ≈øo are we cho≈øen in Chri≈øt. God
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115140:111"/>doth chu≈øe a man as freely, as if Chri≈øt did never die; and yet God ≈øaves none, but for Chri≈øts ≈øaxe; and this makes election on Gods part mo≈øt free. God doth not con≈øider Chri≈øt, nor the good works we have, but tis onely his own good will engages him to ≈øave ≈øome, and neglect others. And thus much for proving this point. There are ≈øome objections now that lie in the way, which mu≈øt be removed.</p>
               <p>God, ≈øay they, doth elect men upon the fore≈øight of their good works; and they alledge foure Scriptures to prove this. <hi>James</hi> 2.2 <hi>Hath not God cho≈øen the poore of this world to be rich in faith?</hi> now, ≈øay they, their laying out their e≈øtates for good u≈øes, and ≈øo becomming poore, that is the rea≈øon why God chu≈øeth them, and neglects richer men.</p>
               <p>To which I an≈øwer. That poore here is onely ≈øpoken of,

And this an≈øwer Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> gives: that poverty is not the cau≈øe why, but the de≈øcription of the per≈øons that are cho≈øen; that Gods decree of election doth commonly runne among the poorer ≈øort of men, the more to advance his own grace; that man ≈øhall not ≈øay, election is intailed upon works: for if poverty ≈øhould be the cau≈øe of their election, then all that are poore ≈øhould be elected, which is fal≈øe. Again further they object,</p>
               <p>2 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God from the beginning hath cho≈øen us to ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through ≈øanctification of the Spirit, and beliefe of the truth.</hi> Now ≈øay they, ≈øanctification, and faith is made as the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, through which election mu≈øt run, and therefore that is the cau≈øe or motive why God did elect them. To this we an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>That it is true, God elects men through ≈øanctification and faith, as the end God aimes at in elect per≈øons, not as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for which he elects them. And this an≈øwer <hi>Rivet</hi> gives. All elect men ≈øhall be ≈øanctified, and all elect men ≈øhall believe; though it is not for this ≈øanctification and beliefe that they are elected. It is not for grace, but unto grace they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen. This di≈øtinction the Scripture gives, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Ye are elect according to the foreknowl dge of God, through ≈øanctification unto obedience.</hi> Not for, as the motive; but to, as the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:115140:112"/>Again, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.1. it is called <hi>the faith of Gods elect.</hi> Now, ≈øay they, it is called ≈øo, becau≈øe God elects them fore≈øeeing their faith. To which we an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>That faith is here called, the faith of Gods elect; not as if God fore≈øeeing faith did elect men; but becau≈øe all elect men ≈øhall believe, becau≈øe faith is a peculiar priviledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing onely to elect men, therefore it is called their faith.</p>
               <p>And then la≈øtly, one Scripture more they alledge, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. <hi>If any man ≈øhall purge him≈øelf from ≈øin, he ≈øhall be a ve≈ø≈øell of honour.</hi> Now here, ≈øay they, <hi>purging,</hi> that is, ≈øanctification, and good works, it is made a condition of election, of being a ve≈ø≈øell of honour. God makes this condition, if he for≈øee a man will purge him≈øelfe, and will live holily, that man ≈øhall be elected, ≈øhall be a ve≈ø≈øell of honour. To which we give this an≈øwer, That purging and ≈øanctification is here laid down, not as the cau≈øe, but as the ≈øigne of their election; not as the cau≈øe why men are ve≈ø≈øels of honour, but the ≈øigne or evidence that they are ≈øo. If you are purged, you ≈øhall be ve≈ø≈øels of honour; that is, if you are ≈øanctified, it is a ≈øign to you, that you are elected.</p>

I am now to proceed further in the di≈øpatch of what yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines to be ≈øpoken concerning this ≈øubject. A fourth query followes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Q. </seg>
                  </label> Fourthly, Whether the decree of election, or Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to ≈øave a company of men, being from eternity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immutable, whether doth not this give way to man to be ≈øecure, and carele≈ø≈øe in the u≈øe of the means of grace, that they take no care to get grace, and to get heaven, while they are in the world? This is a very u≈øefull point to in≈øi≈øt upon, ≈øeeing the <hi>Arminians</hi> charge us with this, that if we hold election without re≈øpect to Gods fore≈øight of workes in men, then this layes open a gap for men to live as they li≈øt, that they ≈øhall ≈øay, If God hath determined they ≈øhall be ≈øaved, they ≈øhall be ≈øaved; if that they ≈øhall be damned, they ≈øhall be damned, whether they are holy, or profane; if God hath elected them to life, they ≈øhall be ≈øaved, let them live as they li≈øt. Thus the <hi>Arminians</hi> plead. This therefore is the query, whether this doctrine of election doth admini≈øter any ground for ≈øuch a cavill as this to be in the minds of men?</p>
               <p>To an≈øwer which, I ≈øhall fir≈øt lay down this generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion, That the decree, or the purpo≈øe of God about the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115140:113"/>election of man to life and ≈øalvation, doth no way admini≈øter any ju≈øt ground to men, to make them live as they li≈øt, and to make them neglect the means of grace and ≈øalvation. In the clearing of which, I ≈øhall lay down three particulars, to ≈øatisfie you about this matter. As,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, that Gods decree about Civill and Temporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, doth no way give encouragement to men to neglect the u≈øe of means, and live carele≈ø≈øe of the accompli≈øhment of his decree; and therefore not ≈øo in ≈øpirituall. As now for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance: God hath determined from all eternity, how long every one of us ≈øhall live in the world; our daies are numbred in his coun≈øell. Now, though God hath determined how long we ≈øhall live, this no way gives us encouragement to ≈øay therefore I will never put on a rag of cloathes to cover me in Winter, and I will never put a mor≈øell of meat in my mouth; for God hath determined how long I ≈øhall live, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether I eate or no, till then I ≈øhall not die. Again, God hath determined from all eternity, touching every one of us, whether we ≈øhall be poore or rich in this world, and therefore to draw this conclu≈øion, that it is no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I be indu≈øtrious in following my calling, and looking after my trade, or whether I ≈øpend my e≈øtate in rioting and drunkenne≈ø≈øe; God hath determined whether I ≈øhall be rich or poore; if he hath decreed I ≈øhall be poore, I ≈øhall be poore; or that I ≈øhall be rich, I ≈øhall be rich, let me live as I plea≈øe: this rea≈øoning is very fond and fooli≈øh in Temporall things, therefore much more in Spirituall. God hath determined from all eternity whether thou ≈øhalt be ≈øaved or damned, and the decree of God cannot be changed; but now to draw hence, that it is no matter how I live, whether in waies of holine≈ø≈øe, or in waies of ≈øinne, this is an abu≈øive collection from Gods decree. Becau≈øe, as Dr. <hi>Pre≈øton</hi> ≈øaith, if a man doth not u≈øe tho≈øe means that may evidence to his ≈øoule that he is elected, it is an argument he is not elected. If thou ≈øay, if God hath determined it, he will ≈øave me, whether I am holy or prophane, and therefore I will never heare Sermon, never pray in my family, never u≈øe holy duties; Saith <hi>Pre≈øton,</hi> if
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115140:113"/>thou neglect the≈øe means, it is an argument thou art not ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; becau≈øe, as God hath elected thee to the end, he hath al≈øo ordained thee to u≈øe the means. I have read a ≈øtory of an <hi>Italian,</hi> who lying upon his death-bed, ≈øent for a Phy≈øician, the mo≈øt exqui≈øite and exact Arti≈øt in all <hi>Italy;</hi> and this man held this opinion I am now ≈øpeaking of, that ≈øeeing Gods decrees were unalterable, a man might live as he li≈øt, and yet be ≈øaved; that let a man be as holy as he could be, if God had decreed his damnation, he ≈øhould be damned; and let a man be never ≈øo wicked, if God have decreed his ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee ≈øhould be ≈øaved; and that the decree of God tooke off the u≈øe of all means, that a man need not u≈øe any meanes, but onely tru≈øt in God. The Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian being a man acquainted in the my≈øteries of Religion, after he had asked him the ≈øtate of his body, and where the di≈øea≈øe lay, the party de≈øiring him to pre≈øcribe ≈øome phi≈øick, the Phi≈øician gave him this an≈øwer: ≈øaith he, God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined how long you ≈øhall live; therefore, if I give you phy≈øick, if God hath determined you ≈øhall die, you ≈øhall die for all that; and if he hath decreed you ≈øhall live, though I give you no phy≈øick, yet you ≈øhall live. And this an≈øwer (≈øaith the Hi≈øtorian) took ≈øuch place with the <hi>Italian,</hi> that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him in this very principle, and he became a man very diligent in following the means of grace, upon this very ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And indeed, a ju≈øt &amp; grounded ≈øpeech it is. This therefore is my fir≈øt an≈øwer, that if ≈øuch rea≈øonings as the≈øe in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things are unrea≈øonable, they are much more in ≈øpirituall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to you that make this plea, I would ≈øay this: That at that very ≈øame in≈øtant wherein God did decree or determine to bring any man to life, at that very in≈øtant God did decree likewi≈øe that that man ≈øhould be holy before hee died; he ≈øhall u≈øe all ≈øanctified and holy means conducible to his ≈øalvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Whom he did prede≈øtinate, them he did prede≈øtinate to be conformable to the Image of his ≈øonne.</hi> God the Father, in that very decree wherein he did ordain man to life, did ordaine, that tho≈øe men elected ≈øhould live conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Je≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He hath cho≈øen us in Chri≈øt,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115140:114"/>before the foundation of the world was laid, that we ≈øhould be holy and blamele≈ø≈øe before him in love.</hi> God did decree, that our lives ≈øhould be holy; he ordaines holine≈ø≈øe as the means, as well as heaven as the end. So <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 2.10. <hi>God hath created us in Chri≈øt Je≈øus unto good works, which he hath before ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that we ≈øhould walke in them.</hi> 2 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 2.13. God, before the world was, at that very in≈øtant wherein he ordained, and cho≈øe men to life, did al≈øo ordaine, that men ≈øhould live a holy and blamele≈ø≈øe life here upon earth. Now then, for men to make this objection, that ≈øeeing God hath decreed men to life, therefore men may live as they li≈øt, is ab≈øurd: for if men doe live as they li≈øt, it is an argument God did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree them to life, becau≈øe God in decreeing men to life and ≈øalvation, did decree they ≈øhould walk in a cour≈øe of ≈øanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and holy living in this world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ≈øuppo≈øe this ≈øhould be taken for granted, that God had decreed to damne thee or me; that God in his purpo≈øe had appointed he would not ≈øave us; yet God, as a Creator, de≈øerves thy ≈øervice. God, as Creator, may lay claime to thy duties. Though God ≈øhould condemne us, yet he making us, de≈øerves obedience, and de≈øerves duties of thankfulne≈ø≈øe from us. And therefore, under this notion onely, though no other con≈øideration be looked after, this ≈øhould engage you to righteous living; and this ≈øhould engage you in a way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though he never ≈øave you. <hi>Adam,</hi> though he never ≈øhould come to heaven, being in innocency, yet being made and created by God, was engaged to live a holy life. And ≈øo it is with every man alive, as we are creatures, and have a being from God, and the comforts of this life from God, all this doth oblige us to a cour≈øe of obedience, and righteous living toward God, though he ≈øhould throw us into hell, when we have done. And thus much for re≈øolving the fourth Query, that the decree of God touching mans election to life, doth no way give encouragement to men to live as they li≈øt, upon the forementioned grounds. I now pa≈ø≈øe to the fifth Query.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, what temptations doth the divell ≈øugge≈øt into the minds of godly men, to make them doubt within them≈øelves,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115140:114"/>that they are not elected by God, when indeed they are, to make them thinke they are <hi>reprobate ≈øilver,</hi> when they are <hi>ve≈ø≈øels of honour, meet for their Ma≈øters u≈øe?</hi> Happily I may ≈øpeak to ≈øome, who≈øe ≈øpirits are perplexed in this ca≈øe. And the an≈øwer hereunto, I ≈øhall reduce to three heads, and as I lay them down, labour to take them off, that they may be no ju≈øt ground or rea≈øon to make you doubt of your election.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, the divell tempts a godly man with this, that ≈øure you cannot be elected, Becau≈øe that before your calling you were ≈øo exceeding ≈øinfull and profane in your lives; ≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly profane, vile, wicked livers, that certainly (the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel will ≈øay) ≈øuch as you could not fall within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods purpo≈øe to ≈øave.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the divell will tell you, that certainly you cannot be elected to life, becau≈øe that after your calling into Je≈øus Chri≈øt, you have fallen ≈øo fouly into capitall, and ≈øcandalous crimes and ≈øinnes.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, becau≈øe that God doth continually pur≈øue his people with outward and great afflictions; thence the divell will gather, you are not the cho≈øen and beloved of God. The≈øe three grand temptations he doth many times fa≈øten upon many tender con≈øciences, meerly to create a world of doubts and perplexities in the cho≈øen ve≈ø≈øels of mercy. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the fir≈øt.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, the divell tempts you, that ≈øure you are not elected, becau≈øe your lives were ≈øo exceedingly profane, and you were ≈øuch abominable ill livers, before you tooke upon you the profe≈ø≈øion of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; this the divell layes before many a poore ≈øoule to ≈øtumble at.</p>
               <p>To ≈øatisfie you in this therefore, I ≈øhall lay down four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars by way of an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Many of the ≈øervants of God before their calling, have been very lewd, wicked, notorious, profane livers, and yet have been within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election to life and glory. Ca≈øt your eyes upon <hi>Paul,</hi> and there you ≈øhall finde what he was before his call. He tels you him≈øelfe, <hi>I was a blu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,</hi> (a horrible ≈øinne) <hi>I was a per≈øecuter, I was injurious
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115140:115"/>to God Church. I haled men to pri≈øon for profe≈ø≈øing the name of Je≈øus.</hi> (The≈øe are great ≈øinnes.) Nay further, ≈øaith he, <hi>I was exceeding mad again≈øt the Church of God.</hi> A man enraged with malice again≈øt the people of God. Now what could be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile then the≈øe? And yet you ≈øhall finde this man, a cho≈øen ve≈ø≈øell of mercy. Nay, you ≈øhall finde, God to ≈øtrengthen the confidence of men upon their election, puts a ≈øcandalous liver and election together, to make men ≈øee, that a ≈øcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous life before conver≈øion, is no prejudice to a mans election. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>And Ananias ≈øaid, Lord, we have heard of this man by many</hi> (≈øpeaking of <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>how much evill he hath done to thy Saints at Hieru≈øalem.</hi> We have heard by many what an evill man this is, <hi>and that he hath authority from the chiefe P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ie≈øts to binde all that call upon thy Name;</hi> and that this man did doe it, did execute his commi≈ø≈øion; here was a wicked liver: but now mark what the Lord ≈øaith, <hi>Goe thy way, for he is a cho≈øen ve≈ø≈øell to me.</hi> Here you ≈øee <hi>Ananias</hi> laies his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and his wickedne≈ø≈øe before him; and yet, <hi>Goe thy way,</hi> ≈øaith God: <hi>Goe thy way, for he is a cho≈øen ve≈ø≈øell to me.</hi> The like in≈øtances we have in <hi>Mana≈ø≈øeth</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> This therefore is my fir≈øt an≈øwer, that many of the ≈øervants of God have been men of very ill and notorious lives, before conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, and yet they have been within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election to ≈øalvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though men have been notoriou≈øly wicked, in their lives before calling, yet if this notorious wickedne≈ø≈øe doth lay an engagement upon them, to make them labour to be more eminent in grace after calling; this is rather a ≈øigne of election, then reprobation. It is ob≈øervable in <hi>Paul,</hi> he was a notorious wicked man before his call; but now this exceeding wickedne≈ø≈øe of his before his call, did engage him to labour to exceed all others in goodne≈ø≈øe after he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and the more evill he was before, the more holy he labours to be after. As he laboured before to hale men to pri≈øon for profe≈ø≈øing Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he is now as zealous to draw men to Je≈øus Chri≈øt after his call; he was very indu≈øtrious to doe evill before his call, and this made him after his call, as he
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115140:115"/>≈øaith him≈øelfe, <hi>I was in labours more abundant then they all.</hi> And ≈øo <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who before her calling was a vile woman, one that was a common harlot; a woman out of whom Je≈øus Chri≈øt ca≈øt ≈øeven divels; and yet this woman, after her calling, ≈øhe laboured to be more eminent in godly ≈øorrow, then any woman before or ≈øince; <hi>≈øhe wa≈øhed Chri≈øts feet with her teares, and wiped them with the haires of her head.</hi> The like of which you do not read of any woman in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And this was a very good ≈øigne; when your notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe in waies of ≈øinne before calling, ≈øhall lay ≈øuch an engagement upon you to become more eminent in grace after calling; this is a very good encouragement or evidence that you are within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election; and therefore you have no cau≈øe to be di≈øcouraged. Suppo≈øe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word laid hold upon your con≈øcience, you were guilty of filthy ≈øinnes, not fit to be named in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if you will the more honour God, and prai≈øe God now, and walk more humbly, and labour to excell each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in grace now, as you did in ≈øinne in times pa≈øt. This is a great ≈øigne that you are in the company of Gods Elect ones.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you that have been ≈øcandalous in your lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling, for your comfort know, that God in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall coun≈øell doth commonly make the profane and wicked and the wor≈øt of men, the objects of his election, rather then civill hone≈øt men, rather then men that are of an hone≈øt and civill, and morall conver≈øation here in this world. And the Lord doth it upon this ground, the more to magnifie the freene≈ø≈øe, and the riches of his own grace in electing men to life. For ≈øhould God onely chu≈øe moderate and civill hone≈øt men in the world, men would be apt to think it is that mans morality, and that mans civility, that was the motive which provoked God to elect them; and therefore God, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the≈øe thoughts, he lets election runne rather unto men that have been notoriou≈øly gro≈ø≈øe and ≈øinfull in their lives, then other men; <hi>Mana≈ø≈øeh</hi> a notorious bloudy man, yet falls within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election, when many a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115140:116"/>civill man is left out. <hi>Mary,</hi> a common harlot, yet cho≈øen, when many a mode≈øt cha≈øte woman was ca≈øt into hell. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31, 32. There Chri≈øt urgeth a parable of two men. <hi>One that ≈øaid he would go and follow Chri≈øt, but did not; and the other ≈øaid he would not goe, but did; now which of the≈øe twaine did the will of Chri≈øt? and they ≈øaid, the fir≈øt. And Je≈øus ≈øaid unto them, Verily I ≈øay unto you, that publicans and harlots ≈øhall goe into heaven before you.</hi> But you will ≈øay, was this common? this was onely one ≈øingle time: therefore mark the next words, <hi>For John came to you in the way of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and you believed not; but the publicans and harlots believed in Chri≈øt. John</hi> came preaching, and you would not believe, you <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øees,</hi> ≈øtrict morall men, that did not flie out into ≈øuch ≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals as other men did, you would not believe, ≈øaith Chri≈øt, but <hi>Publicans,</hi> men that were mo≈øt addicted to extortion, and uncon≈øcionable gaine, <hi>they imbraced Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> when mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men would not. This therefore ≈øhould be another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for you, that many times election runnes rather to the profaner ≈øort of men, then to men that are civill and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dealing men here in the world; and this God doth to magnifie the riches of his own grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that it is no matter what you were before your calling, ≈øo you are a repentant and holy people after; your former mi≈øcarriages ≈øhall no way prejudice your future ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øedne≈ø≈øe. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Neither Fornicator, nor Idolater, nor Adulterer, nor envious, nor thiefe, nor covetous, nor reviler ≈øhall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven: and ≈øuch were ≈øome of you &amp;c.</hi> Here you ≈øee a Catalogue of vile evils heaped together, <hi>and ≈øuch were ≈øome of you; but now you are wa≈øhed, now you are ≈øanctified, &amp;c.</hi> So that no matter what you were before conver≈øion, though guilty of great ≈øinnes, ≈øo you are now a reformed people, now a ≈øanctified people, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.3. <hi>We our ≈øelves al≈øo were ≈øometimes fooli≈øh, di≈øobedient, deceived, ≈øerving divers lu≈øts and plea≈øures, and living in malice and envie, &amp;c.</hi> You were ≈øo; <hi>but after the kindne≈ø≈øe and love of God appeared to you,</hi> after they were called and converted they were not ≈øo. So that the≈øe foure particulars will clearly take off this
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115140:116"/>objection, that no matter what you were before conver≈øion, if you are now a repentant people, and bewaile your evils, and reform your waies, your former ill led life will be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance at all to your election. Indeed this I mu≈øt needs ≈øay, that you that have been mo≈øt notorious in ≈øinne, God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects this at your hands, that you be mo≈øt eminent in grace, mo≈øt deep in humiliation, mo≈øt eminent in godly ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, though your former evills doe no way prejudice your election.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the divell cannot fa≈øten this upon you, he will come upon you with this a≈ø≈øault, <hi>viz.</hi> your frequent falling into ≈øcandalous and foule, and gro≈ø≈øe enormities, after you took upon you a profe≈ø≈øion of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And this the divell will lay clo≈øe: happily ≈øinne before conver≈øion was not ≈øo great; but now ≈øince you have followed Sermons, and ≈øince you have profe≈ø≈øed Je≈øus Chri≈øt, ≈øince that time you have fallen foulely into gro≈ø≈øe and ≈øcandalous ≈øinnes, and ≈øurely this is incon≈øi≈øtent with grace, and cannot befall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>And I confe≈ø≈øe this is both ≈øad and hazardous: yet I ≈øhall lay down three things to uphold thee, that yet for all this thou mai≈øt be within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, that divers per≈øons who were within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election, have fallen foulely into gro≈ø≈øe ≈øinnes after their call. <hi>Lot,</hi> after he was called, fell to be ince≈øtuous, and fell to drunkenne≈ø≈øe; <hi>David,</hi> after he was called, fell into Adultery; <hi>Peter,</hi> after he was called, fell to a deniall of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt. Yea, you read of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.9. <hi>That his heart was turned from the Lord, after the Lord had revealed him≈øelfe unto him twice.</hi> After God had revealed him≈øelfe to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and converted him; after that time he did evill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his God. Nay, you read further, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.26, 27. That <hi>Solomons wives turned away his heart from the Lord, though he was the beloved of his God.</hi> Though he were belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by God, and were elected by him, yet his wives turned away his heart from the Lord. The like phra≈øe you have
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115140:117"/>
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.22. <hi>After all the≈øe great works, I have done amongst them, and the miracles I have ≈øhewn them in Aegypt, and in the Wilderne≈ø≈øe, they have provoked me, ≈øaith the Lord, the≈øe ten times.</hi> After they were the Lords by covenant, and after they were a delivered people; after this they provoked him many a time, by ≈øinning again≈øt him, and yet divers of them were elect ve≈ø≈øels of mercy. So that, I ≈øay, many of Gods ≈øervants after their calling, are fallen foulely into ≈øcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ≈øinnes, and yet have been within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you falling into gro≈ø≈øe and ≈øcandalous ≈øinnes, have not the≈øe foure ≈øinfull ingredients, your falling into ≈øinne after calling, may be con≈øi≈øtent with election. Fir≈øt, if you fall not into ≈øinne voluntarily. Secondly, if you fall not into the ≈øame ≈øinne frequently. Thirdly, if you fall not into ≈øinne with complacency. And fourthly, if you lie not under your fall impenitently. If the≈øe ingredients be mixed with your ≈øinning after your call, they are incon≈øi≈øtent with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Fir≈øt, if you fall into ≈øinne voluntarily, <hi>that you ru≈øh into ≈øinne, as a hor≈øe into the battell.</hi> Secondly, if you fall into the ≈øame ≈øinne frequently, then it is hazardous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. It is true <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chri≈øt, but it was but in one fit of a temptation. <hi>David</hi> fell into Adultery, but it was never but once; <hi>Lot</hi> was guilty of drunkenne≈ø≈øe, but onely in one fit: For the ≈øervants of God, though they fall, yet they fall not frequently into the ≈øame ≈øinne, if gro≈ø≈øe and ≈øcandalous. Thirdly, if you fall into ≈øinne with compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that you take plea≈øure in the evils you fall into; if you doe as <hi>Job</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>wallow ≈øinne under your tongue;</hi> counting it ≈øweet and delight≈øome to you. And la≈øtly, if all this be joyned with impenitency, that you have not a heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the evils you fal into, the Lord have mercy upon you; for certainly, if you fall into ≈øinne with the≈øe ingredients, you are not within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods mercy to ≈øave. But now, though you doe fall into ≈øinne, if it be not voluntary, but through the force of temptation: if it be not with compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, but a di≈ølike of the ≈øins you fall into; and as ≈øoon as
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115140:117"/>you doe fall, and ≈øee your ≈øinnes you repent and ri≈øe again, though you doe fall in this way, it will be no prejudice to your election.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, falling into ≈øinne after calling and profe≈ø≈øion made of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, may be con≈øi≈øtent with election in the≈øe foure ca≈øes. Fir≈øt, if the ≈øinnes you fall into be clearly di≈øcerned. Secondly, if they are ≈øen≈øibly bewailed. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they are ≈øtrongly re≈øi≈øted; and la≈øtly, if they are daily laboured, and prayed again≈øt. Though you doe fall into ≈øinne, yet in the≈øe ca≈øes ≈øinne will not be damning to you, or be an impediment to your election. And thus I have done with the ≈øecond ca≈øe of con≈øcience. Onely, let me urge this one thing before I leave it, (for I would not have you make this doctrine a doctrine of liberty; but I would have you lay this to heart) that if any of you doe fall foulely, after conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion; believe it, God will make you ≈ømart for this, though not in hell, yet you ≈øhall have a hell in your con≈øcience, you ≈øhall have the very pregu≈øtations of hell, a wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, and God will expect deep humiliation, and great repentance, if you ≈øinne after profe≈ø≈øion made of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. It may have that influence upon you, as upon <hi>David,</hi> who cried out, <hi>I have no quietne≈ø≈øe in my bones, by rea≈øon of my ≈øinne.</hi> God will give you no re≈øt night nor day by rea≈øon of ≈øinne, if you runne into it after profe≈ø≈øion made of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, men doe doubt of their election, becau≈øe God pur≈øues them with continuall afflictions, and layes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ≈øtrokes of his heavy wrath upon them; and this makes many a godly man thinke, that he is not in the number of Gods elect ones. To which I ≈øhall briefly an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>That this is nothing el≈øe but a temptation, and not a truth; and it was the very controver≈øie that <hi>Jobs</hi> friends had with him; they would fa≈øten this upon <hi>Job,</hi> that he was a Reprobate, and an Hypocrite, becau≈øe God did ≈øo afflict him: yet <hi>Job</hi> maintained his ≈øincerity, and ≈øhewes his grounds, that God was his friend, and that he did not reject him, though he did afflict him. But to ≈øpeake more particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:115140:118"/>Fir≈øt, no man can infallibly and certainly judge of Gods purpo≈øes about mans election, or reprobation, by any of the di≈øpen≈øations of God toward their bodies in the things of this life. <hi>Eccle≈ø.</hi> 9.1, 2. <hi>No man knows either love or hatred by any thing that is before him. All things fall alike to all. The ≈øame event to him that feareth God, and to him that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him not, to him that ≈øweareth, and to him that feareth an Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Afflictions from God are ≈øo farre from being grounds, or evidences that a man is not elected, that in ≈øome ca≈øes they may prove evidences that they are the very elect of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7. <hi>He cha≈øteneth every ≈øonne whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; they are ba≈øtards, and not ≈øonnes, whom he cha≈øti≈øeth not. As many as I love, I rebuke and cha≈øten, be zealous therefore and repent.</hi> Revel. 3.19. In ≈øome ca≈øes afflictions from God are rather tokens of love from God, then the contrary. As now, in ca≈øe afflictions be as a ≈øpur to you, to make you quicken your pace in heaven way. 2. In ca≈øe your afflictions be as pruning-hookes to you, to cut and lop off the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant buddings, and workings of ≈øinne in the heart. 3. In ca≈øe affliction be as a hedge to you to keep you in, and to make you walke in a clo≈øe communion with God, and not to wander or goe a≈øtray from him. 4. In ca≈øe affliction be as a file to you, to file off that ru≈øt that cleaves to your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 5. In ca≈øe affliction proves a furnace to refine you from that dro≈ø≈øe of corruption that is mixt with your ≈øervices. In the≈øe ca≈øes afflictions are ≈øo farre from being grounds to doubt of your election, that they may rather give you evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, you are the very elect of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that God in his wi≈ødome doth many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe his own people to greater troubles in this life, then he lets wicked and reprobate men undergoe. God will not give reprobates their hell here, that ≈øo he might give them hell hereafter. God will not give the elect heaven here, to make heaven more de≈øirable to them, while they live here; and more welcome when they come there. It is Gods plea≈øure
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115140:118"/>in the di≈øpen≈øations of his providence among≈øt men, to let his own people lie under more outward ≈øorrows, then wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men ≈øhall doe. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 73.5. <hi>Their eyes bur≈øt out with fatne≈ø≈øe, they are not in trouble, as other men, neither are they plagued, as other men are.</hi> The Lord in his di≈øpen≈øations doth ≈øo deale with wicked men, that they are not plagued, they are not troubled, as godly men are in this world. And therefore ≈øurely affliction is no argument of Gods di≈øplea≈øure, or of their not being within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods purpo≈øe to doe them good.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THe Doctrine I am yet upon is this, <hi>That Chri≈øtians ≈øhould put forth a great deale of diligence to make this ≈øure to their ≈øoules, that they are eternally elected by God to life and ≈øalvation.</hi> In the pro≈øecution of which Doctrine, I have gone over ≈øeverall particulars; and have now only one Querie more to ≈øatisfie about election; and then to winde up this Doctrine, in laying down ≈øome explicatory propo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, very conducible to illu≈øtrate this Doctrine of Election. And the Quere to be re≈øolved is this.</p>
               <p>What are tho≈øe delu≈øions of the divell whereby he nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øheth pre≈øumptuous per≈øwa≈øions in the minds of men, that they are elected by God, when they are not? And to an≈øwer this, I ≈øhall reduce all I have to ≈øay under the≈øe three heads.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, the divell per≈øwades wicked men that they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, upon this ground. Becau≈øe they doe not break forth into ≈øuch gro≈ø≈øe and ≈øcandalous enormities in their lives, as many men that live about them doe: and therefore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell boul≈øters them up in this, Surely if you were not elected, you would be as bad as any, and as vile and exorbitant as any. Now ≈øeeing God keepes you in, that you act not ≈øuch things in your lives, as other men doe; this may be a comfortable evidence to you, that you are in the number of Gods elect ones. And this delu≈øion deceives thou≈øands of people, e≈øpecially morallized, and civillized men; they runne hoodwinkt to hell, nouri≈øhing hopes of life and ≈øalvation, and never feele the contrary, till they come
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115140:119"/>to death and hell. I ≈øhall declare this to be a delu≈øion, in laying down four or five particulars. As,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, That there are many men, that are mentioned in Scripture, not to have been within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election, who yet were men of very blamele≈ø≈øe and hone≈øt lives, not blemi≈øhed with any gro≈ø≈øe and ≈øcandalous evils. Read <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11, 14. of the Phari≈øee. He tels you, <hi>he thanks God he was no extortioner, no adulterer, no covetous per≈øon, no drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, nor was he as wicked as the Publican was.</hi> Here you ≈øee a man that ≈øpake vauntingly and truely, that he was not a man that broke out into tho≈øe mi≈øcarriages other men did; yet what was this man? An elect ve≈ø≈øell? No. Read ver≈ø. 14. and the Text tels you, <hi>the Publican went away ju≈øtified, rather then the other;</hi> the Phari≈øee, though he was free from ≈øcandalous and gro≈ø≈øe enormities in his life, yet he was not a ju≈øtified man, and ≈øo by con≈øequence not an elect man. You read of Hypocrites, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>that clean≈øed the out≈øide of the cup and of the platter,</hi> that is, clean≈øed their conver≈øations, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the outward man of gro≈ø≈øe ≈øcandals, <hi>and yet within were full of filth;</hi> and Chri≈øt tels us, they were <hi>hypocrites,</hi> that <hi>≈øhould have their portion in hell.</hi> And ≈øhould you view over Hi≈øtorians that write of the Scribes and Phari≈øees, and ≈øtrict men among the Jewes, they will tell you what wonderfull holy-lived men they were; they were often in duties, fa≈øted twice a week, prayed every day in the corners of the ≈øtreets; none ≈øo ≈øtrict as they in ob≈øerving the Sabbath; would goe vailed, le≈øt they ≈øhould be en≈ønared by la≈øcivious objects; and yet the≈øe very men ≈øo wonderfull ≈øtrict, and cautious, were men that had no dram of grace in them at all. Though they were a people thus well dre≈ø≈øed in their lives, yet the Scripture tels us of them, that Whores and Harlots ≈øhould goe to Heaven before them. This therefore is the fir≈øt, that many men have had their lives free from gro≈ø≈øe ≈øcandals, and yet were men that were not elected by God to life and ≈øalvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that a mans conver≈øation may be free from ≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ≈øinnes, yet if this freedome from ≈øcandals proceed from a wrong principle, it may be in a per≈øon not elected. As I will
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115140:120"/>make it appeare. There may be a freedome from gro≈ø≈øe ≈øinnes proceeding from a threefold principle, and yet a man be in a ≈øtate of damnation and of reprobation. As fir≈øt, There may be a freedome from ≈øcandals, proceeding from religious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ≈øecondly, from a naturall di≈øpo≈øition; and thirdly, from the power of re≈øtraining grace. Fir≈øt, there may be a freedome from gro≈ø≈øe ≈øinnes, proceeding from the power of education. So the young man in the Go≈øpell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.18, 19, 20. when Chri≈øt told him what the Law was. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not commit adultery, thou ≈øhalt not ≈øteale, thou ≈øhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ≈øelfe, thou ≈øhalt doe no murder, thou ≈øhalt not beare fal≈øe witne≈ø≈øe, &amp;c.</hi> Saith the young man, <hi>All the≈øe have I kept from my youth.</hi> He was a Phari≈øee, and his parents ≈øtrict in their cour≈øe of living, and brought him up ≈øo from his youth; and yet this man no elect man, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 22. Secondly, a man may be free from ≈øcandalous ≈øins, ari≈øing from an ingenious naturall di≈øpo≈øition. A mans di≈øpo≈øition may ≈øometimes be utterly aver≈øe to ≈øome ≈øinnes. <hi>Plutarch</hi> a heathen could ≈øay this, I had rather it were ≈øaid, there were no ≈øuch man as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the world, then to ≈øay, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> was uncha≈øte, <hi>Plutarch</hi> was a drunkard, or <hi>Plutarch</hi> was a ≈øwearer. Mans naturall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per may ≈øometimes be free from gro≈ø≈øe ≈øinnes, and yet he not an elect per≈øon for all this. And then thirdly, a man may be free from gro≈ø≈øe ≈øinnes, as proceeding from the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraining grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. <hi>I al≈øo withheld Abimelech from ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning again≈øt me.</hi> He was a heathen, and a wicked man, and yet God, by the power of re≈øtraining grace, did keepe <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> from running into that exorbitant cour≈øe of ≈øinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him. So that if a man be free from gro≈ø≈øe ≈øinnes, and yet proceeding from fal≈øe principles, a man may not be an elect man for all this. Unle≈ø≈øe your freedome from ≈øinne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a renewed nature, from a ≈øanctified heart, and from the ≈øaving operation of the holy gho≈øt; unle≈ø≈øe it comes from the≈øe principles, your freedome from gro≈ø≈øe ≈øinnes can be no pledge to your ≈øoules, that you are elected by God to life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that a man having a good life, free from ≈øcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115140:120"/>≈øinnes, if he have not a good heart, that is no argument of a man that is within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; nor is that circumci≈øion, which is outward in the fle≈øh, but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly, and circumci≈øion is of the heart, who≈øe prai≈øe is not of men, but of God.</hi> Intimating, that he is not a Chri≈øtian; he is not an elect Jew, that was one outwardly; that is, that was conformable to the rites and cu≈øtomes of the Jewes; but he was one that was one inwardly, that had his ≈øinnes morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, his nature changed, and his heart clean≈øed, he was an elect Jew. So that to have a holy life, if a man have not an holy heart, is no ≈øign that a man is within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God in electing men to life, doth pa≈ø≈øe by morall and civill hone≈øt men, that tru≈øt and depend upon their own righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe and ≈øtrict living, rather then any ≈øort of men in the World. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31, 33. ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>John Bapti≈øt preached the Go≈øpel of repentance, but you believed not, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and harlots believed.</hi> Tho≈øe Phari≈øees that did depend upon their own righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, &amp; their own goodne≈ø≈øe, Chri≈øt did not call them, Chri≈øt did not own them, God made them not the objects of his election. Hence it is ≈øaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Chri≈øt came not to call the righteous, but ≈øinners to repentance:</hi> that is, men depending upon their own righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and their own parts, they are left out by Chri≈øt, as if he came not for them; but Chri≈øt came to call ≈øinners, that ≈øee their ≈øinne, and were vile in their own eyes, Chri≈øt came to call ≈øuch. Againe,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ≈øecond delu≈øion, whereby the divel makes men think they are elected by God, is drawn from their externall voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that they are not onely civilized, and moralized ones, but they finde the power of the word to call them; and upon this vocation they bottom the hopes of their election. And they have Scripture for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom God prede≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates he calls.</hi> Now God hath called them by the word, and they have found the word come with power upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, to reforme the evils of their life. (And the power of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115140:121"/>vocation they deem higher (as indeed it is) then the power of education, or naturall temper;) and therefore, think they, I having vocation, this is an evidence to me of my election. To this delu≈øion I ≈øhall only ≈øay two things, by way of an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, it is true indeed, the Scripture ≈øaith, all whom God prede≈øtinates, he calls; but the Scripture doth not ≈øay, that all whom he calls, he prede≈øtinates. No man that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points to life, but before he dies, God will call him by the word; but God doth not ≈øay any where, that tho≈øe whom he cals, them he did prede≈øtinate to life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, many men are outwardly called by the word into a profe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt, when they are not eternally elected by God to ≈øalvation. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Many are called, but few are cho≈øen.</hi> Many are called, but all tho≈øe that are externally called by the word, are not cho≈øen, nor all ordained to life. A man may be called from ignorance to knowledge, yet not elected. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>After they were enlightned, and had ta≈øted the word of God, and the power of the world to come, yet they fell away.</hi> A man may be called from profanene≈ø≈øe to profe≈ø≈øion, from the world into the Church, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was, yet not elected, but remaine <hi>in the gall of bitterne≈ø≈øe, and bond of iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, A third delu≈øion, whereby men are deceived by the divell, to think they are elected, when they are not is this, If they cannot plead their education, and morall manner of living, or if they cannot plead their vocation, their la≈øt plea is, the mercy of God; they hope God is a mercifull God, and God made them not all to damne them; they are Gods creatures, made by him, and God that made them, will ≈øave them; and hereupon they fa≈øten their hopes, that they are in the number of Gods elect ones. This is a ≈øtrong delu≈øion, e≈øpecially among≈øt ignorant people. And to this I ≈øhall an≈øwer in two particulars.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, when as men ≈øay, God is a mercifull God, therefore they hope they are elected, I an≈øwer: It is true, God is a mercifull God, yet God is as ju≈øt as mercifull; he is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ju≈øt, and ju≈øtly mercifull; his mercy cannot intrench
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115140:121"/>upon his ju≈øtice, nor ≈øhall his ju≈øtice intrench upon his mercy; one Attribute ≈øhall not cla≈øh with another; he is no more mercifull, then he is ju≈øt, nor is he more ju≈øt then he is mercifull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though God be a mercifull God, yet Gods ≈øaving mercy is not ≈øo large as to extend to all creatures that live, that he hath made. You read <hi>E≈øay</hi> 27.11. <hi>This is a people of no under≈øtanding, therefore hee that made them will not have mercy upon them, and he that formed them will ≈øhew them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> Here you ≈øee, the Prophet tels them, that that God that made them will damne them, and that God that formed them, that God will ≈øhew them no favour. So that Gods mercy extends not ≈øo farre, as to reach to all the works of his hands; for if ≈øo, the divels might claime ≈øalvation as well as man; for God made them when they were glorious Angels, as well as man: and therefore, if all the works of Gods hands ≈øhould plead for ≈øalvation, they might as well come within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election, as wicked men doe.</p>
               <p>And thus you ≈øee in the≈øe ≈øeverall Sermons, I have fini≈øhed the Doctrines of Effectuall Vocation, and Eternall election. I will now a little illu≈øtrate the point, by laying down ten Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions, which will ≈øerve to cleare the Doctrine of Election in many points about it, and ≈øo conclude.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, That all men are not the objects of Gods election, or of Gods choice. And this propo≈øition doth confute the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Origen. Origen</hi> was of this mind, that all mankind ≈øhould be ≈øaved, nay, the very divels them≈øelves, they ≈øhould all be ≈øaved by Chri≈øt. A mo≈øt groundle≈ø≈øe, and unheard of opinion; for all men are not elected to ≈øalvation. <hi>Jude</hi> tels us, in his Epi≈øtle, there were ≈øome <hi>of old ordained to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> and if ≈øo, ≈øurely they could not fall within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe of Gods election, 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 5.9. There are ≈øome <hi>ordained to wrath;</hi> but we are not among≈øt them ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>but we are ordained to obtaine ≈øalvation by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> All are not objects of Gods election to life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the fewe≈øt ≈øort of men and women that God
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115140:122"/>hath made are the the objects of his election. God in his own coun≈øell hath elected to life and ≈øalvation the fewe≈øt ≈øort of men and women in the world. And this is a very dreadfull point, <hi>Many are called, but few are cho≈øen. Matth.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>A remnant, according to the election of grace.</hi> And here in pur≈øuing this head, I ≈øhall lay down two things under this propo≈øition: Fir≈øt, that there are but few rich men cho≈øen by God to life and ≈øalvation. Secondly, there are but few civill hone≈øt men cho≈øen by God to life and ≈øalvation. There are but few rich men that fall within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to ≈øave, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Not many mighty,</hi> (he doth not ≈øay, not any; but <hi>not many mighty</hi>) <hi>not many Noble, not many great ones of the world are cho≈øen.</hi> You read <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.24. <hi>That it is as ea≈øie for a Camell to goe thorough a Needles eye, as for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of God. As ea≈øie for a Camell.</hi> It is not meant in this ≈øence, as ≈øome expound it. That there was a gate in <hi>Hieru≈øalem,</hi> called the Needles eye; a little and low gate, which their Camels being laden could not goe through, and therefore they mu≈øt unload the burden, and the Camell ≈øtoop before they could enter. Some think Chri≈øts ≈øpeech had relation to that <hi>Beza</hi> ≈øaith, that in≈øtead of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> a Camel, they read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> a Cable; which, if untwi≈øted may be put through the eye of a Needle, but the knot is not untied, but cut by this expo≈øition. But the words were a proverbiall ≈øpeech among the Jewes, who had this proverb among≈øt them, that when any one ≈øpake things either unlikely or unproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they would ≈øay, This can be as ea≈øily done, as a Camel can goe through a Needles eye. And Chri≈øt, alluding to this Proverb, ≈øaith, that rich men, that dote upon their riches, and cleave to their wealth, and rather part with heaven, and Chri≈øt, and ≈øoule and all, then part with their riches, Chri≈øt makes it an unpo≈ø≈øible thing for ≈øuch rich men to come into heaven. As I once told what <hi>Buchanan</hi> ≈øaid, lying upon his death-bed in a me≈ø≈øage to King <hi>James,</hi> I am going to that place, where few Kings come. And, beloved, the ≈øpeech is true, for <hi>not many wi≈øe, not many mighty, not many Noble hath the Lord cho≈øen.</hi> Secondly, few civill hone≈øt men doe fall
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115140:122"/>within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods choyce to ≈øave. Morall men, that tru≈øt upon their civility and morall hone≈øty, and plain dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; few or none of the≈øe come to Heaven. <hi>Publicans and Harlots ≈øhall come to Heaven before you.</hi> Matth. 21.32. Whores and harlots believe in me, when you doe not, ≈øaith Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that though God in his own coun≈øell, hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or made choice but of the fewe≈øt number of men and women to life and ≈øalvation, yet this doth no way intrench upon the mercy of God, this doth no way le≈ø≈øen or impeach the mercy of God. Men may think, as if ≈øurely God had ca≈øt off all bowels, and ca≈øt off all mercy. What? God make ≈øuch a world of men as he hath done, and ≈øave but a few of the≈øe? Man might think, as if God were a hard ma≈øter, that deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the de≈øtruction of man, that had forgotten to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; ≈øuch a hard charge will they be apt to lay upon God. But now, beloved, that God hath elected ≈øo few a number to life, this doth no way impeach the mercy of God. And this I make appeare thus: becau≈øe God was bound to ≈øave none at all; therefore you cannot challenge God either with unmercifulne≈ø≈øe, or unfaithfulne≈ø≈øe, if he ≈øhould ≈øave none. It was a meer act of his bounty and good will, that he would ≈øave any. Nay, ≈øecondly, there is that in man, in the be≈øt of men, that might ju≈øtly provoke God not to ≈øave any: And therefore if God ≈øave any, it is of grace. And this is a certain rule, that God doth ≈øhew more mercy in ≈øaving of one, then he would have done rigour of ju≈øtice, had he damned all. As may be made plain by this compari≈øon. Suppo≈øe fourty men guilty of Rebellion were arraigned for their lives, and were condemned to die by the Law; if the Prince pardon foure of the≈øe forty, he ≈øhewes more mercy in pardoning the foure, then he doth rigour of ju≈øtice in condemning the forty. Why? becau≈øe the fact de≈øerved death, in all alike. So it is with God: every man upon earth de≈øerves death and damnation; &amp; if God cull out any of the ma≈ø≈øe of mankind, to ≈øave them, he ≈øhewes more mercy, then he had done rigorous ju≈øtice, ≈øhould he have de≈øtroyed all, becau≈øe he is bound to ≈øave none at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:115140:123"/>Fourthly, God in electing a certain number to life, doth it without fore≈øight of any good works which he ≈øaw would be in them. Indeed the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> joyn their ≈øtrength, to maintaine this; God, ≈øay they, fore≈øaw men would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chri≈øt, and would be holy in their lives, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did chu≈øe them to life. This you may remember I ≈øpent ≈øome time in overthrowing formerly, and therefore pa≈øs it over now. <hi>viz.</hi> That God did not chu≈øe men to life, with reference to any good works he fore≈øaw in them. This indeed is an undoubted truth; All men whom God did elect to life, he fore≈øaw they would have good works in them; but Gods fore≈øeeing of this, was not the cau≈øe for which God did elect them. No, the motive was his own will, according to the plea≈øure of his own grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>A rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are ≈øaved according to the election of grace, for if it were of works, grace is no more grace.</hi> Were election upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øight of good workes, then it would follow, that infants dying in infancy were not within the compa≈ø≈øe of Gods election, becau≈øe an infant ≈øo dying, could not performe any good works; and ≈øo their ca≈øe would be mo≈øt mi≈øerable. Be≈øides, we are not ju≈øtified by actuall workes, therefore not elected upon works fore≈øeen. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. for there is the like rea≈øon of the≈øe two.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That Gods election is ≈øo free, that in chu≈øing and electing men to life and ≈øalvation, he doth not doe it for the ≈øake of Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelfe. Under≈øtand this well, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you might both give Chri≈øt his due, and God the father his due: for mi≈øtake me not. God doth ≈øave none but by Chri≈øt, but God did elect men without reference to Je≈øus Chri≈øt as the motive of election, meerly according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe of his own will. All modern and latter Divines lay down this for a truth, that it was the meere plea≈øure, and good will of God to man, that was the motive of Gods elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and not Chri≈øt. Chri≈øt could not be the cau≈øe, becau≈øe he was the effect. Now what is the effect, cannot be the cau≈øe. Gods love in electing mankind, did produce Je≈øus Chri≈øt to be the meanes of our ≈øalvation, and of bringing about Gods
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115140:123"/>election, therefore he being the effect of election cannot be the cau≈øe. The cau≈øe of election was eternall, but the merits of Chri≈øt were not ≈øo. Again, Chri≈øt was elected him≈øelfe. 1 Pet. 1.20. <hi>He was preordained of God before the World was.</hi> Now he that was elected him≈øelf, could not be the cau≈øe of our election. Be≈øides the elect are ≈øaid to be given to Chri≈øt to be ≈øaved, <hi>John</hi> 17.2. therefore he was not the cau≈øe of our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It is true, the Scripture tels us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>We are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Chri≈øt,</hi> i. we are elected in Chri≈øt as a common per≈øon. God fir≈øt cho≈øe Chri≈øt, and then believers in Chri≈øt, as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body. But God elects no man for Chri≈øts ≈øake, but man is cho≈øen meerly of Gods bounty, without reference to Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And here Divines ≈øay, Gods love in electing man to life was as free, as if Chri≈øt had never died; and it was ≈øo free, that man was not beholding to Chri≈øt for his election; and yet Chri≈øts ≈øufferings were ≈øo full, as if men were not bound to God for their election. Thus they are plea≈øed to expre≈ø≈øe it. And the rea≈øon why the Scripture ≈øpeakes th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>s, that we are onely cho≈øen in Chri≈øt, not for Chri≈øt, is to give God the Father his due in electing men to life: that God did it meerly of his own grace, and therein Gods love and favour is apparent to all the world, that he did elect man without Chri≈øt, as the motive of his election: and yet Je≈øus Chri≈øt being come into the world, he carries on our ≈øalvation, and he is the cau≈øe of it; though he was not the cau≈øe of Gods fir≈øt thoughts, in electing man to life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All men that are elected by God to life and ≈øalvation ≈øhall ≈øooner or later before they die be called into a ≈øtate of conver≈øion, and believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he did prede≈øtinate, them he al≈øo called:</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternall life believed.</hi> So that God the father, in ordaining man to life, hath ordained this al≈øo, that before they die, they ≈øhall be a converted and believing people, and therfore men remaining unconverted, uncalled, unbelieving, they are not the objects of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, that God in chu≈øing or electing men to life, doth let his election runne ordinarily unto the meane≈øt, and unto
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115140:124"/>the wor≈øt ≈øort of men in the world, men that have lea≈øt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall endowments, le≈øt morall excellencies, lea≈øt worldly gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry; ordinarily election runs that way. <hi>God hath cho≈øen the poore things of this world, and things de≈øpi≈øed, and things that are not hath he cho≈øen.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.27. Jam. 2.5. <hi>Hath not God cho≈øen the poore of this world to be rich in faith.</hi> Ordinarily the Lord chu≈øeth poor and meane men, that have no naturall or morall excellencies. Hence it was that when Chri≈øt left the learned Phari≈øees, and Doctors among the Jewes, the ignorant and poore people, they flocked after Je≈øus Chri≈øt; they looked after Je≈øus Chri≈øt, when the rich and great men of the world had no ≈øhare in him.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, that a man may be an elect child of God, and yet not expre≈ø≈øe the fruit of his election in many yeeres here in the world, and this is a very comfortable point. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance you have of this in <hi>Paul.</hi> It is ob≈øervable of <hi>Paul,</hi> the Scripture tels us <hi>he was a cho≈øen ve≈ø≈øell,</hi> Acts 9.15. and yet <hi>Paul</hi> lived many yeeres, before the fruit of his election appeared in him. Some Hi≈øtorians ≈øay, <hi>Paul</hi> lived 37. the lea≈øt ≈øay 30 yeers, before the fruit of election appeared in him, for he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the very yeere after Chri≈øts death; and all the while before, he did expre≈ø≈øe fruit that was ≈øeemingly repugnant to an elect e≈øtate, as if a man could not be an elect ve≈ø≈øell, that was ≈øo vile as he: <hi>he was a bla≈øpheme, a per≈øecuter, injurious to the Church, haled men to pri≈øon, mad with rage again≈øt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øors of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> Nay, he was a man that had a hand in putting <hi>Steven</hi> the fir≈øt Martyr to death. So long he lived in a cour≈øe of iniquity, for 30. yeeres together, and yet this man was an elect ve≈ø≈øell then. So the Thiefe upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, an elect child of God, yet did not expre≈ø≈øe the fruit of his election in repentance and conver≈øion, untill the la≈øt houre of his life. So that I ≈øay a man may be an elect childe of God, and yet not expre≈ø≈øe the fruit of his election in his life for many yeeres.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, that God for the great love he beares to his elect that are in the world, lets Reprobates and wicked men enjoy many mercies and outward deliverances, for their ≈øakes. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.19, 20. <hi>There ≈øhall be tribulation,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>≈øuch as was
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115140:124"/>not from the beginning of the world, nor ≈øhall be to the end thereof: but for the elect ≈øake tho≈øe daies ≈øhall be ≈øhortned.</hi> For his elect ≈øake, God did mitigate, did ≈øhorten, God did take away that trouble from them. So <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Had not God le≈øt us a ≈ømall remnant, we had been like Sodome, yea like unto Gomorrha.</hi> Had not God left a handfull of his elect and godly men among≈øt them, all the re≈øt had been de≈øtroyed. So <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 65.8. <hi>And the Lord ≈øaid, de≈øtroy not the people, for a ble≈ø≈øing is among them.</hi> That is, my people is among them, and my elect is among them, therefore de≈øtroy them not. God did not de≈øtroy the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jewes, becau≈øe God had his own people mixed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. So <hi>Job</hi> 22.30. And this conclu≈øion admini≈øters matter of thankfulne≈ø≈øe, to all men upon earth, to make you ble≈ø≈øe God, that he keepes his people alive among you, for it is for the elects ≈øake you have all the outward ble≈ø≈øings and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies you doe enjoy.</p>
               <p>Tenthly and la≈øtly, take in this conclu≈øion: That this world ≈øhall continue no longer, then till the number of Gods elect be accompli≈øhed; when God hath accompli≈øhed, and brought in to Chri≈øt the number of his elect; the world ≈øhall not ≈øtand one minute longer after this worke is done. God doth but uphold the world, till the full number of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> be come in. If the number were filled, <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt would ≈øurrender up the Kingdome to his Father.</hi> The Heavens ≈øhould gather together like a ≈øcrowle, and the Elements ≈øhould melt with fervent heat, and this world ≈øhould come to a di≈ø≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. It is the elect in the world, that keep up the world, that it doth not fall about our eares. And thus having ≈øpent the≈øe 16 Sermons touching mans Effectuall calling, and eternall Election, I have now brought all unto a conclu≈øion. And I earne≈øtly intreat you, let it be your work, <hi>to put forth your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make this ≈øure to your own ≈øoules, that you are effectually called, and that you are eternally elected to obtaine life and ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi>
